# Effective Prompting

Here's a quick tip on writing effective prompts for AI models.

## Be Specific

The more specific your prompt, the better the results. Include:

- Clear instructions
- Context information
- Expected format
- Examples when helpful

## Use the Right Structure

Structure your prompts with:

1. Context setting
2. Task description
3. Format requirements
4. Constraints or limitations

## Example

Bad prompt:
```
Write about AI
```

Good prompt:
```
Write a 3-paragraph explanation of how large language models work, 
aimed at high school students with no technical background. 
Include an analogy to help explain the concept.
```

This simple structure will help you get more consistent and useful results from AI models.
