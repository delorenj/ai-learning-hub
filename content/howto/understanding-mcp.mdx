# How To Think About MCP
*Distilled from the transcript an in-depth technical discussion*
## Introduction: What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a fundamental shift in how AI systems interact with external tools and services. Think of it as the *bridge that connects LLMs with the broader digital ecosystem, enabling seamless communication between AI clients and various tools, APIs, and services.

I found the perfect analogy, unlocking a deeper understanding of what is truly possible and its glaring underutilization
## The HTTP Analogy: Understanding Client-Server Protocols
To truly understand MCP, let's start with something familiar: HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).
### HTTP: The Web's Foundation
When you browse the internet, you're using HTTP without even thinking about it. Here's how it works:

- **Clients**: Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- **Servers**: Web servers (nginx, Apache, etc.) hosting websites
- **Contract**: HTTP defines the rules - when you request a URL, the server responds with properly formatted HTML

The beauty of HTTP lies in its universality. You can use any browser to access any website because they all speak the same protocol. The browser doesn't need to know if the server is running nginx or Apache - it just needs to understand HTTP.
### MCP: The Same Pattern for AI
MCP follows this exact same pattern, but instead of web browsers talking to web servers, we have AI clients communicating with tool servers:

- **Clients**: AI development environments (Cursor, Claude, VS Code extensions)
- **Servers**: Tools and services (GitHub integration, file systems, APIs)
- **Contract**: MCP defines how AI systems can discover and use external capabilities

Just like you can't "pay for HTTP" because it's an open protocol, MCP is freely available and can be implemented by anyone.
## MCP Components: Breaking Down the Architecture
### 1. The Client Side
AI development environments act as MCP clients:
- **Cursor**: Popular AI-powered code editor
- **Claude**: Anthropic's AI assistant with MCP support
- **VS Code**: With MCP extensions
- **Custom applications**: Any software that implements the MCP client specification
### 2. The Server Side
MCP servers provide specific capabilities:
- **GitHub Server**: Access repositories, create issues, manage pull requests
- **File System Server**: Read and write local files
- **Database Server**: Query and update databases
- **Custom Tools**: Any functionality you want to expose to AI
### 3. The Protocol Itself
MCP handles the communication layer:
- **Tool discovery** Think of this as the API or the service’s interface. The big difference here is that tools’ high-level description is just as important as the underlying implementation. The easier you can make it for an LLM to decide when and when not to use a tool, the more powerful the system becomes.
- **Parameter negotiation** Once an LLM decides to use a tool, it needs a clear enough and accurate enough description of the parameters so it can perform the key magic trick that would have been science fiction not long ago: It can sift through it’s available context, make sense of it from a top-down perspective, and extract the nuanced bits that map the context to the tool parameters.
- **Execution coordination** Just like humans, AI is most successful at just the right level of task granularity. Having an intern run a full sprint cycle, groom the backlog, tweak the UX and handle QA would understandably result in a pile of garbage. The new engineer’s problem is the careful division of labor into tasks artfully optimized by modular specialization of agent hierarchies. If you read that again and carefully think about what that describes you’ll realize that’s basically the definition of a modern corporate structure
## Real-world Examples and Use Cases
### GitHub Integration
One of the most compelling examples is GitHub's MCP server. Instead of AI systems having to understand GitHub's specific API quirks, they can use the standardized MCP interface:
```
AI Request: "Create a new issue about the login bug"
MCP Server: Translates to GitHub API calls
GitHub: Creates the issue
MCP Server: Returns success confirmation
AI: Confirms to user: "Issue #42 created successfully"
```
### Multiple Implementations
The power of protocols shines when you have multiple implementations. For GitHub alone, there are several MCP server options:
- **GitHub's official server**: Direct from the source
- **Anthropic's implementation**: Optimized for Claude
- **Community versions**: Specialized for specific use cases

You can choose the implementation that best fits your needs, just like choosing between different web browsers.
## Why MCP Matters for AI Development
### 1. Standardization
Before MCP, every AI tool had to create custom integrations for each service. Now, once a service has an MCP server, any MCP-compatible AI can use it immediately.
### 2. Flexibility
Want to switch from one AI assistant to another? If they both support MCP, your tool integrations come with you. No vendor lock-in.
### 3. Extensibility
Building new capabilities becomes straightforward. Create an MCP server for your internal tools, and suddenly any MCP client can access them.
### 4. Future-Proofing
As Anthropic designed MCP, they thought far beyond just tool execution. The protocol supports:
- Resource sharing
- Prompt templates
- Sampling and model interactions
- Much more that we're only beginning to explore
## The Bigger Picture
What makes MCP particularly exciting is its potential. Currently, most implementations focus on tools - the ability for AI to execute functions and interact with services. But the protocol was designed with much broader capabilities in mind.

Think about how HTTP started primarily for serving static web pages but eventually enabled:
- Dynamic web applications
- REST APIs
- Real-time communication
- Streaming services
- IoT device communication

MCP has similar potential to evolve and enable use cases we haven't even imagined yet.
## Getting Started with MCP
### For Developers
1. **Choose your client**: Start with Cursor or Claude for the easiest experience
2. **Install existing servers**: Try the GitHub server or file system server
3. **Experiment**: See how AI can interact with your tools through MCP
4. **Build your own**: Create MCP servers for your specific needs
### For Organizations
1. **Assess your tools**: What internal systems could benefit from AI integration?
2. **Pilot project**: Start with one tool and build an MCP server
3. **Scale gradually**: Add more services as you see value
4. **Train your team**: Help developers understand the MCP paradigm
## Implementation Diversity
Just like the web ecosystem, MCP supports multiple programming languages and approaches:
- **Python**: Quick prototyping and data science tools
- **TypeScript**: Web-based integrations and Node.js services
- **Rust**: High-performance, memory-safe implementations
- **Docker**: Containerized servers for easy deployment
## The Road Ahead
MCP represents more than just another protocol - it's a fundamental infrastructure piece for the AI-powered future. As more tools adopt MCP servers and more AI systems become MCP clients, we'll see an explosion of capabilities.

The conversation that inspired this article highlighted something crucial: MCP isn't just a technical specification, it's a new way of thinking about AI integration. Instead of building point-to-point connections between every AI and every tool, we're creating a universal language that lets them all communicate.
