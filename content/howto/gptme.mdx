# How to Use GPTME

GPTME is a powerful terminal-based AI assistant that brings AI capabilities directly to your command line. It's perfect for quick tasks, file operations, and automation.

## What GPTME is Good For

- **Quick file operations**: Creating, editing, and organizing files
- **Simple automation scripts**: Bash, Python, or other scripting tasks  
- **Terminal workflows**: Git operations, package management, system tasks
- **Code snippets**: Small utility functions and one-off scripts

<Badge variant="default">Popular Use Case</Badge>

## What GPTME is NOT Good For

- **Complex coding projects**: Large applications with multiple files
- **MCP interactions**: May not work with Model Context Protocol (last checked)
- **Long-running processes**: Better suited for quick, discrete tasks

## Install Instructions

First, install GPTME using pip:

```bash
pip install gptme
```

Then verify the installation:

```bash
gptme --version
```

<TODO>Add advanced configuration options and examples here.</TODO>

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of using GPTME to create a Python script:

```bash
gptme "Create a Python script that counts lines in a file"
```

This is **MDX content** with custom components working! You can use:

- Custom `<Badge>` components
- `<TODO>` components for development notes
- Enhanced code blocks with syntax highlighting
- And much more!

## Next Steps

1. Try GPTME with simple file operations
2. Experiment with automation scripts  
3. Integrate into your daily terminal workflow

> **Pro Tip**: GPTME works best when you give it specific, concrete tasks rather than vague requests.
