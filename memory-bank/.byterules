# Memory Bank Document Orchestration Standard

## Directory Validation

Before any operation (create/update/reference/review), ensure you are in the correct project root directory. Specifically:

- A valid Memory Bank system **must contain** this `.byterules` file at its root.
- If this file is missing, halt operations and **navigate to the correct directory** using:

```bash
cd /your/project/root
```

Failing to validate the directory can lead to misplaced or inconsistent documentation.

## System Overview

Memory Bank is a structured documentation system designed to maintain project knowledge in an organized, accessible format. This `.byterules` file serves as the standard guide for how the system works across all projects.

## Standard Document Types

### 1. Project Brief (projectbrief.md)
- **Purpose**: Core document that defines project objectives, scope, and vision
- **When to Use**: Reference when making any major project decisions
- **Workflow Step**: Start here; all other documents derive from this foundation
- **Critical For**: Maintaining alignment with business goals throughout development

### 2. Product Context (productContext.md)
- **Purpose**: Documents product functionality from a user perspective
- **When to Use**: When designing features and establishing requirements
- **Workflow Step**: Second document in sequence, expands on project brief goals
- **Critical For**: Ensuring user needs drive technical decisions

### 3. System Patterns (systemPatterns.md)
- **Purpose**: Establishes system architecture and component relationships
- **When to Use**: During system design and when making integration decisions
- **Workflow Step**: Third document, translates product needs to technical design
- **Critical For**: Maintaining a coherent and scalable technical architecture

### 4. Tech Context (techContext.md)
- **Purpose**: Specifies technology stack and implementation details
- **When to Use**: During development and when onboarding technical team members
- **Workflow Step**: Fourth document, makes concrete technology choices
- **Critical For**: Technical consistency and efficient development

### 5. Active Context (activeContext.md)
- **Purpose**: Tracks current tasks, open issues, and development focus
- **When to Use**: Daily, during planning sessions, and when switching tasks
- **Workflow Step**: Fifth document, operationalizes the technical approach
- **Critical For**: Day-to-day execution and short-term planning

### 6. Progress (progress.md)
- **Purpose**: Documents completed work, milestones, and project history
- **When to Use**: After completing significant work or during reviews
- **Workflow Step**: Ongoing document that records the project journey
- **Critical For**: Tracking accomplishments and learning from experience

## Standard Workflows

### Documentation Sequence
Always follow this sequence for document creation and reference:
1. **Project Brief** → Foundation of all project decisions
2. **Product Context** → User-focused requirements and features
3. **System Patterns** → Architecture and component design
4. **Tech Context** → Technology choices and implementation guidelines
5. **Active Context** → Current work and immediate focus
6. **Progress** → Historical record and milestone tracking

### Document Lifecycle Management
Each document follows a standard lifecycle:
1. **Creation**: Establish initial content based on project needs
2. **Reference**: Use document for planning and decision-making
3. **Update**: Revise when relevant factors change
4. **Review**: Periodically validate for accuracy and completeness
5. **Archive**: Maintain as historical reference when superseded

## Best Practices

### Document Quality Standards
- **Clarity**: Write in clear, concise language
- **Completeness**: Include all relevant information
- **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology across documents
- **Structure**: Follow standardized document formats
- **Granularity**: Balance detail with readability
- **Traceability**: Link related concepts across documents

### Document Integration Principles
- **Vertical Traceability**: Ensure business goals trace to technical implementation
- **Horizontal Consistency**: Maintain alignment across documents at the same level
- **Change Impact Analysis**: Update related documents when one changes
- **Decision Recording**: Document the reasoning behind significant decisions
