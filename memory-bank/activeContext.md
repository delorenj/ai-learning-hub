# Active Context: AI Learning Hub Productionization - Sprint 3

This document outlines the current active context for Sprint 3 of the AI Learning Hub Productionization project.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals for Sprint 3 are:

*   **Implement Dynamic Content Rendering:**  Successfully render course content dynamically from the CMS, including text, images, and code snippets.
*   **CMS Integration:** Finalize the integration of the chosen CMS (Contentful) with the front-end application.
*   **User Authentication & Authorization (Phase 1):** Implement basic user authentication (login/logout) and role-based authorization to restrict access to admin functionalities.
*   **Testing Framework Integration:** Integrate Jest and Cypress for unit and end-to-end testing, respectively.  Write initial test suites for key components.

## Ongoing Tasks

*   **Contentful API Integration:**  Refactoring existing components to consume data from the Contentful API.  (Assigned: Alice, Bob)
*   **User Authentication Implementation:** Implementing the user authentication flow using Auth0. (Assigned: Carol, David)
*   **Admin Dashboard Development:** Building the initial admin dashboard interface for content management. (Assigned: Eve, Frank)
*   **Testing Setup & Implementation:** Configuring Jest and Cypress and writing initial tests for the content rendering and authentication modules. (Assigned: George, Hannah)
*   **Performance Optimization:** Addressing initial performance bottlenecks identified in Sprint 2. (Assigned:  Ivy)
*   **Documentation Updates:** Updating technical documentation to reflect changes made during the sprint. (Assigned: Jack)

## Known Issues

*   **Contentful API Rate Limiting:**  Experiencing occasional rate limiting issues with the Contentful API during development.  Working on implementing caching strategies to mitigate this.  (Severity: Medium, Priority: High)
*   **Auth0 Configuration Complexity:** Auth0 configuration is proving more complex than initially anticipated.  Seeking assistance from the Auth0 support team. (Severity: Medium, Priority: High)
*   **Image Optimization:**  Images served directly from Contentful are not optimized for web delivery, leading to slow page load times.  Investigating image optimization strategies. (Severity: Low, Priority: Medium)
*   **Component Reusability:**  Some components are becoming overly complex and lack reusability.  Needs refactoring. (Severity: Low, Priority: Medium)

## Priorities

1.  **Contentful API Integration & Rate Limiting Solution:**  Critical for enabling dynamic content delivery.
2.  **User Authentication Implementation:**  Essential for security and access control.
3.  **Testing Framework Integration:**  Ensures code quality and maintainability.
4.  **Admin Dashboard Development (Basic Functionality):**  Enables content management by authorized users.
5.  **Image Optimization:** Improves user experience.
6.  **Component Reusability:** Improves code maintainability.

## Next Steps

*   **Daily Stand-up Meetings:** Continue daily stand-up meetings to track progress and address roadblocks.
*   **Contentful Caching Implementation:** Prioritize implementation of caching mechanisms to alleviate Contentful API rate limiting issues. (Target Completion: May 27th)
*   **Auth0 Consultation:** Schedule a consultation with Auth0 support to resolve configuration complexities. (Target Completion: May 28th)
*   **Code Review:** Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and identify potential issues early on.
*   **Sprint Review Meeting:**  Schedule a sprint review meeting for [Date of Sprint Review] to demonstrate completed features and gather feedback.
*   **Sprint Retrospective:**  Conduct a sprint retrospective following the review to identify areas for improvement in the next sprint.

## Meeting Notes

**May 24, 2025 - Daily Stand-up Meeting:**

*   **Alice:**  Making progress on Contentful API integration but still encountering rate limiting issues.  Will focus on implementing a basic caching mechanism today.
*   **Bob:**  Assisting Alice with Contentful integration and exploring different caching strategies.
*   **Carol:**  Struggling with Auth0 configuration.  Need to schedule a consultation with Auth0 support.
*   **David:**  Helping Carol debug Auth0 configuration issues.
*   **Eve:**  Working on the initial admin dashboard layout.
*   **Frank:**  Implementing basic content creation functionalities in the admin dashboard.
*   **George:**  Configured Jest and wrote initial unit tests for the content rendering module.
*   **Hannah:**  Setting up Cypress for end-to-end testing.
*   **Ivy:**  Investigating image optimization techniques.
*   **Jack:**  Updating documentation on Contentful API usage.

**Action Items:**

*   **Carol:** Schedule Auth0 support consultation.
*   **Ivy:** Research and propose an image optimization solution by May 26th.
*   **Project Manager:**  Monitor Contentful API rate limits and escalate if necessary.
