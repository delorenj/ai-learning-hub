# System Patterns

This document outlines the system patterns employed in the AI Learning Hub project, focusing on architectural design, data models, API definitions, component structure, integration points, and the scalability strategy.

## 1. Architectural Design: Modular Monolith with Microservices Tendencies

We are employing a modular monolith architecture as the foundation, with the potential for future extraction of modules into microservices as the platform scales and specific needs arise.

*   **Rationale:** This approach balances the simplicity of a monolith (easier development, deployment, and testing) with the flexibility of microservices. We avoid the initial complexity of a full microservices architecture while still allowing for future decomposition.

*   **Key Modules:** The application is structured into distinct modules based on domain functionality:
    *   **Content Management Module:** Handles content creation, editing, versioning, and publication.
    *   **User Management Module:** Manages user accounts, authentication, authorization, and profiles.
    *   **Learning Path Module:** Defines and manages learning paths, including course sequences and prerequisites.
    *   **Search Module:** Provides search functionality across all content types.
    *   **Analytics Module:** Collects and analyzes user engagement data.
    *   **API Gateway:** (See Integration Points) A single entry point for all external requests.

*   **Communication:** Modules primarily communicate through well-defined interfaces and events. Direct database access between modules is discouraged. Event-driven architecture is used for asynchronous operations (e.g., content updates triggering search index updates).

## 2. Data Models

All data models are defined using TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety and consistency throughout the application. We will use a relational database (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage.

*   **Content Model:**

    ```typescript
    interface Content {
      id: string;
      contentType: 'article' | 'video' | 'quiz' | 'codeSnippet';
      title: string;
      description: string;
      content: string; // Markdown or other format
      authorId: string;
      createdAt: Date;
      updatedAt: Date;
      tags: string[];
      status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'archived';
      metadata: { [key: string]: any }; // Allow for flexible metadata
    }
    ```

*   **User Model:**

    ```typescript
    interface User {
      id: string;
      username: string;
      email: string;
      passwordHash: string;
      firstName: string;
      lastName: string;
      role: 'admin' | 'user';
      createdAt: Date;
      updatedAt: Date;
      profile: { [key: string]: any }; // Allow for customizable profiles
    }
    ```

*   **Learning Path Model:**

    ```typescript
    interface LearningPath {
      id: string;
      title: string;
      description: string;
      courses: string[]; // Array of Content IDs
      createdAt: Date;
      updatedAt: Date;
      status: 'draft' | 'published';
    }
    ```

*   **Relationships:**
    *   One-to-many relationship between users and content (one user can author many pieces of content).
    *   Many-to-many relationship between content and tags.
    *   One-to-many relationship between learning paths and content (one learning path contains many courses).
    *   Many-to-many relationship between users and learning paths (users can enroll in multiple learning paths).

## 3. API Definitions

We will use RESTful APIs for external access and internal communication between modules where synchronous communication is required. All APIs will be documented using OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications.

*   **Content API:**

    *   `GET /content`: Retrieves a list of content items (supports pagination and filtering).
    *   `GET /content/{id}`: Retrieves a specific content item by ID.
    *   `POST /content`: Creates a new content item (requires authentication and authorization).
    *   `PUT /content/{id}`: Updates an existing content item (requires authentication and authorization).
    *   `DELETE /content/{id}`: Deletes a content item (requires authentication and authorization).

*   **User API:**

    *   `POST /users/register`: Registers a new user.
    *   `POST /users/login`: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.
    *   `GET /users/me`: Retrieves the current user's profile (requires authentication).
    *   `PUT /users/me`: Updates the current user's profile (requires authentication).

*   **Learning Path API:**

    *   `GET /learning-paths`: Retrieves a list of learning paths.
    *   `GET /learning-paths/{id}`: Retrieves a specific learning path by ID.
    *   `POST /learning-paths`: Creates a new learning path (requires authentication and authorization).
    *   `PUT /learning-paths/{id}`: Updates an existing learning path (requires authentication and authorization).

*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used for authentication and authorization.

## 4. Component Structure

The application will be structured into reusable components, following a component-based architecture. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.

*   **UI Components (React):**
    *   `ContentCard`: Displays a summary of a content item.
    *   `ContentEditor`: Provides a rich text editor for creating and editing content.
    *   `UserAvatar`: Displays a user's avatar.
    *   `LearningPathCard`: Displays a summary of a learning path.
    *   `SearchBar`: Provides a search input field.

*   **Backend Components (Node.js/Express):**
    *   `ContentService`: Handles business logic related to content management.
    *   `UserService`: Handles business logic related to user management.
    *   `LearningPathService`: Handles business logic related to learning path management.
    *   `DatabaseConnector`: Provides a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
    *   `AuthenticationMiddleware`: Handles authentication and authorization.

*   **Component Communication:** Components communicate through props (for UI components) and function calls/dependency injection (for backend components).

## 5. Integration Points

*   **API Gateway:**  A dedicated API Gateway (e.g., using Kong or a custom solution built with Express) sits in front of the application, handling routing, authentication, authorization, and rate limiting. This provides a single entry point for all external requests and allows for future scaling and modification of the backend architecture without affecting clients.
*   **Search Index:** Integration with a search index (e.g., Elasticsearch or Algolia) for fast and efficient search capabilities.  Content updates will trigger updates to the search index via events.
*   **Analytics Platform:** Integration with an analytics platform (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel) to track user engagement and platform usage.
*   **Payment Gateway (Future):** Integration with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) for handling subscriptions or one-time purchases of premium content (planned for a later phase).

## 6. Scalability Strategy

The scalability strategy focuses on both horizontal and vertical scaling, with an emphasis on horizontal scalability for long-term growth.

*   **Horizontal Scaling:**
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application using a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, AWS ALB).
    *   **Database Replication:** Implement database replication for read scalability and high availability.
    *   **Caching:** Utilize caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load and improve response times.  Cache frequently accessed content, user profiles, and search results.
    *   **Microservices (Future):** Decompose the monolith into microservices as needed, allowing for independent scaling of specific modules.

*   **Vertical Scaling:**
    *   Increase the resources (CPU, memory) of individual servers as needed.  This is a simpler approach for initial scaling but has limitations.

*   **Database Optimization:**
    *   Optimize database queries and indexing for performance.
    *   Regularly review and optimize the database schema.

*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilize message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous tasks, such as sending email notifications and processing large datasets.  This offloads work from the main application threads and improves responsiveness.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Use a CDN to serve static assets (images, videos, CSS, JavaScript) from geographically distributed servers, improving performance for users around the world.
