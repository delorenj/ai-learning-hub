# AI Learning Hub - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Transform the existing AI Learning Hub into a comprehensive, production-ready web platform for AI development workshops with dynamic content management capabilities.

## Current State Analysis
- Next.js 14 application with basic structure
- Docker containerization configured
- Basic navigation and layout components
- Static content structure in place
- Missing: dynamic content features, modern tooling, TypeScript migration

## Primary Objectives

### Phase 1: Foundation Modernization
Modernize the existing codebase to establish a solid foundation for future development:

1. **Infrastructure Enhancement**
   - Add Traefik labels to docker-compose for reverse proxy support
   - Integrate mise as package manager and task runner
   - Complete TypeScript migration for type safety
   - Ensure full Tailwind CSS integration
   - Implement shadcn/ui component system

2. **Code Quality & Standards**
   - Establish consistent code conventions
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add comprehensive linting and formatting
   - Ensure Docker optimization

### Phase 2: Dynamic Content System
Build dynamic content management capabilities to transform static content into an interactive learning platform:

1. **Content Architecture**
   - Create reusable content card components for grid layouts
   - Implement dynamic content loading from markdown files
   - Build content view pages for full-page content display
   - Support MDX rendering for interactive content

2. **Page Implementations**
   - Dynamic how-to guides page with content grid
   - Dynamic tip-snips page with content grid
   - Individual content view pages with markdown rendering
   - Navigation between content items

3. **Content Management**
   - File-based content management from `/content` directory
   - Metadata extraction from markdown frontmatter
   - Content categorization and tagging
   - Search and filtering capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Development Environment
- Node.js 18+ with TypeScript
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for component library
- mise for task running and package management
- Docker with multi-stage builds

### Content System
- MDX support for interactive content
- Frontmatter metadata parsing
- Dynamic routing for content pages
- Responsive grid layouts
- Content preview cards

### Deployment
- Docker containerization
- Traefik reverse proxy support
- Production optimizations
- Health check endpoints

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Completion
- All TypeScript migration complete with zero type errors
- mise integration working for all development tasks
- shadcn/ui components properly integrated
- Docker build succeeds with all optimizations
- Traefik labels configured correctly

### Phase 2 Completion
- Dynamic content loading from markdown files
- Functional content grid layouts on how-to and tip-snips pages
- Individual content pages rendering MDX properly
- Responsive design across all devices
- Navigation between content working seamlessly

## Future Considerations
- User authentication and personalization
- Content creation/editing interface
- Progress tracking for tutorials
- Interactive code examples
- Integration with AI chatbot for enhanced learning

## Acceptance Criteria
Each task must have measurable acceptance criteria that can be validated through:
- Unit tests where applicable
- Integration tests for content loading
- Visual regression tests for UI components
- Performance benchmarks for page load times
- Docker build and deployment verification
