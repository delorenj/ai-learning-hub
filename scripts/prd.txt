Product Requirements Document: AI Workflow Workshop v2 Refactoring

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The AI Workflow Workshop v2 is an existing Next.js application that serves as a web platform for an immersive AI development workshop. The application currently uses JavaScript, CSS Modules, and static content. This PRD outlines the requirements for refactoring the application to use modern technologies and implement dynamic content features.

OBJECTIVES:
1. Modernize the tech stack by migrating to TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn components
2. Implement dynamic content loading from markdown/MDX files
3. Add proper development tooling with mise task runner
4. Enhance deployment configuration with Traefik labels
5. Create a scalable content management system for how-to guides and tip-snips

TARGET AUDIENCE:
- AI developers and enthusiasts with varying experience levels
- Workshop participants seeking hands-on AI development knowledge
- Instructors managing workshop content

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

Phase 1 - Technology Stack Modernization:

   - Document all available tasks

5. Docker Configuration
   - Add Traefik labels to docker-compose.yml
   - Ensure compatibility with existing deployment process

Phase 2 - Dynamic Content Features:
