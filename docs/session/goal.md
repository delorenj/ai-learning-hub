# Goal

To deeply dive into the code, and understand it thoroughly. Take what we know, and codify a path to the final depliverable using your task master tools.

## Instructions

1. **Read the Code**: Go through the code base and understand its structure, functionality, and purpose.
2. Extract all the requirements - both explicitly defined in various documents and implicitly defined in the code.
3. **Identify the Deliverable**: Determine what the final deliverable should be based on the requirements. This should be a clear file structure including all the necessary files and their contents, and a dockerfile/docker-compose file that contains all the necessary steps and services to run the application.
4. Combine the above with the high-level path breakdown (shown below) to create a comprehensive plan for the final deliverable, expanded into a comprehensive task list using your task master tools.
5. Analyze the task complexity and expand as needed.
6. Finally, initialize your memory bank with all the knowledge you have gained from the code, the requirements, and the tasks

## Path Breakdown

1. First, let's get the existing code to where we want it to be by addressing the low-hanging fruit I identified in small TODO comments in the code.

- This includes:
  - Adding a traefik label to the docker-compose file
  - Incorportating mise as package manager and task runner
  - Refactoring the code to use typescript
  - Refactoring the code to use tailwindcss
  - Refactoring the code to use shadcn

2. Then we can start building the dynamic content features.

- This includes:
  - Creating a component card that can be used to display the how-to guides and tip-snips in a grid layout.
  - Enabling the dynamic content on the how-to page and the tip-snips page to populate the grid with the content from the appropriate content directory/files
  - Creating a content view page that can be used to display the content of a how-to guide or a tip-snip in a full page view by rendering the mdx file in a markdown viewer.

3. TBD
