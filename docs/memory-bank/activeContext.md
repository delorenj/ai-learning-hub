## Current Sprint Goals (Sprint 3: Polishing & RAG Integration)

The primary goal of this sprint is to finalize the core functionality of the AI Development Workshop, focusing on polishing the user interface and fully integrating the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot with Jarad's knowledge base. This includes:

*   **RAG Chatbot Integration:** Fully functional RAG chatbot capable of answering user questions accurately and efficiently using Jarad's knowledge base. This includes robust error handling and a user-friendly interface for interaction.
*   **UI/UX Polishing:** Refine the overall user experience of the workshop hub, ensuring intuitive navigation, clear instructions, and a visually appealing design.  Address reported usability issues from user testing.
*   **Content Finalization:** Review and finalize all workshop content, including tutorials, examples, and documentation, to ensure accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
*   **Testing and Bug Fixing:** Thoroughly test all aspects of the workshop and address any identified bugs or issues.
*   **Deployment Preparation:** Prepare the workshop for initial deployment to a limited beta group.

## Ongoing Tasks

*   **RAG Chatbot Development:**
    *   Fine-tuning the embedding model for improved relevance.
    *   Implementing conversational memory for more context-aware responses.
    *   Adding a feedback mechanism for users to rate chatbot responses.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   Implementing visual cues to guide users through workflows.
    *   Optimizing the interface for different screen sizes.
    *   Improving the search functionality within the workshop hub.
*   **Content Review:**
    *   Verifying the accuracy of all code examples.
    *   Updating documentation to reflect the latest changes.
    *   Creating a FAQ section for common user questions.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Conducting comprehensive unit tests for all modules.
    *   Performing integration tests to ensure seamless interaction between components.
    *   Running user acceptance testing (UAT) with a small group of testers.
*   **Deployment Scripting:**
    *   Automating deployment to the staging environment.
    *   Documenting the deployment process.

## Known Issues

*   **RAG Chatbot Accuracy:** The chatbot sometimes provides inaccurate or incomplete answers, particularly for complex or nuanced questions. (Priority: High)
*   **UI Responsiveness:** The workshop hub can be slow to load on certain browsers and devices. (Priority: Medium)
*   **Inconsistent Formatting:**  Minor inconsistencies in formatting across different sections of the workshop content. (Priority: Low)
*   **Limited Error Handling:** The application lacks robust error handling, leading to uninformative error messages in some cases. (Priority: Medium)

## Priorities

1.  **RAG Chatbot Accuracy:** Resolving the accuracy issues with the RAG chatbot is the highest priority.  This is critical for the workshop's core value proposition.
2.  **UI Responsiveness:** Improving the UI responsiveness is the second highest priority. A slow and unresponsive interface will negatively impact the user experience.
3.  **Limited Error Handling:** Implementing better error handling is important for providing a smoother and more informative user experience.
4.  **Content Finalization:** Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the workshop content is essential for its educational value.
5.  **Inconsistent Formatting:** Addressing the minor formatting inconsistencies is the lowest priority and can be addressed after the other issues are resolved.

## Next Steps

*   **RAG Chatbot:**
    *   Experiment with different embedding models and vector database configurations.
    *   Implement a more sophisticated ranking algorithm for retrieved documents.
    *   Add a mechanism for the chatbot to ask clarifying questions when necessary.
*   **UI/UX:**
    *   Profile the application's performance to identify bottlenecks.
    *   Optimize images and other assets for faster loading times.
    *   Implement caching mechanisms to reduce server load.
*   **Content:**
    *   Schedule a final review of all content with Jarad.
    *   Update the FAQ section based on user feedback.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Address all bugs reported by the UAT testers.
    *   Conduct performance testing to ensure the application can handle a large number of concurrent users.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Finalize the deployment scripts and documentation.
    *   Prepare the staging environment for deployment.
