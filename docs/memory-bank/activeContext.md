## Active Context: AI Workflow Workshop v2 Refactor - Sprint 2

This document outlines the active context for Sprint 2 of the AI Workflow Workshop v2 refactor project.

### Sprint Goals

*   **Primary Goal:** Complete the core refactoring of the AI workflow components from JavaScript to TypeScript, focusing on type safety and maintainability.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Integrate TailwindCSS and begin implementing the base UI components using shadcn/ui.
*   **Stretch Goal:** Implement dynamic MDX content loading for the workshop modules.

### Ongoing Tasks

*   **TypeScript Refactoring:**
    *   Migrate the `data-processing` module to TypeScript (Assigned to: Alice) - *In Progress, estimated completion: 5/26/2025*
    *   Refactor the `model-training` module to TypeScript (Assigned to: Bob) - *In Progress, estimated completion: 5/27/2025*
    *   Implement TypeScript interfaces and types for shared data structures (Assigned to: Alice & Bob) - *In Progress, estimated completion: 5/28/2025*
*   **TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui Integration:**
    *   Configure TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui in the project (Assigned to: Carol) - *Completed, awaiting review*
    *   Develop the `WorkshopCard` component using shadcn/ui (Assigned to: Carol) - *In Progress, estimated completion: 5/25/2025*
*   **Dynamic MDX Content Loading:**
    *   Research and implement a solution for dynamic MDX loading using Next.js (Assigned to: David) - *In Progress, initial research complete, prototype implementation started, estimated completion: 5/29/2025*
*   **Deployment Configuration:**
    *   Update the `Dockerfile` and deployment scripts to reflect the new project structure (Assigned to: Eve) - *Not Started, scheduled to begin 5/27/2025*
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Update the project README with the new technology stack and development instructions (Assigned to: Frank) - *Not Started, scheduled to begin 5/29/2025*

### Known Issues

*   **Type Compatibility Issues:** Encountering some type compatibility issues during the TypeScript migration, particularly with legacy JavaScript code. Requires careful type annotations and potentially code restructuring.
*   **shadcn/ui Theming:** Customizing the default theme in shadcn/ui is proving more challenging than anticipated. Requires further investigation into the theming options.
*   **MDX Performance:** Initial tests with dynamic MDX loading show potential performance bottlenecks with large MDX files. Requires optimization strategies (e.g., caching, code splitting).

### Priorities

1.  **TypeScript Refactoring (High):** Completing the core refactoring is critical for long-term maintainability and scalability.
2.  **TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui Integration (High):** Establishing the base UI foundation is essential for building a modern and responsive user interface.
3.  **Dynamic MDX Content Loading (Medium):** Implementing dynamic content loading will enhance the flexibility and maintainability of the workshop modules.
4.  **Deployment Configuration (Low):** Updating the deployment configuration can be deferred until the core refactoring and UI integration are more mature.
5.  **Documentation (Low):** Updating the documentation should be done after the major refactoring tasks are completed.

### Next Steps

*   **Address Type Compatibility Issues:** Alice and Bob will prioritize resolving the type compatibility issues encountered during the TypeScript migration.
*   **Investigate shadcn/ui Theming:** Carol will dedicate time to exploring the theming options in shadcn/ui and finding a solution for customizing the default theme.
*   **Optimize MDX Performance:** David will research and implement optimization strategies to address the potential performance bottlenecks with dynamic MDX loading.
*   **Code Review:** Carol's TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui configuration needs to be reviewed by Alice or Bob.

### Meeting Notes (5/23/2025 - Daily Standup)

*   **Alice:** Made good progress on the `data-processing` module refactoring. Encountered some challenges with the `lodash` library, but found a workaround using TypeScript-native array methods.
*   **Bob:** Successfully refactored most of the `model-training` module. Needs to refactor tests.
*   **Carol:** Completed the TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui configuration. Working on the `WorkshopCard` component. Struggling with theming.
*   **David:** Initial research on dynamic MDX loading is promising. Prototype implementation is underway.
*   **Eve:** Reviewed updated deployment scripts. Ready to start task on 5/27/2025
*   **Frank:** Awaiting the completion of refactoring to update documentation.
