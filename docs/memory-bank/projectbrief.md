The AI Workflow Workshop v2 is an existing Next.js 15 application that serves as a web platform for AI development education. Currently built with JavaScript and CSS Modules, the project needs modernization to TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn components. 

Key existing features:
- Homepage with grid of AI development topics
- Navigation to /howto, /tipsnips, and /resources pages
- Integration with "Jarad, kinda Chatbot" widget
- Docker deployment to DigitalOcean droplet

Current tech stack:
- Next.js 15 App Router
- React 19
- JavaScript (to be converted to TypeScript)
- CSS Modules (to be replaced with TailwindCSS)
- Docker containerization

The refactoring aims to improve developer experience, enable dynamic content loading from MDX files, and create a scalable content management system for workshop materials.
