## Technology Context (techContext.md)

This document outlines the technologies, tools, environments, and processes used in the development and deployment of the Immersive AI Development Workshop project.

### Technologies Used

*   **Programming Languages:** Python
*   **AI/ML Frameworks:**
    *   PyTorch (for model development and training)
    *   Transformers library (for working with pre-trained language models)
    *   Langchain (for RAG implementation and orchestration)
*   **Database:** ChromaDB (for vector storage of the Jarad knowledge base)
*   **Frontend:** React (JavaScript library for building the user interface)
*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python framework for creating APIs)
*   **Containerization:** Docker (for packaging the application and its dependencies)
*   **Cloud Platform:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) or equivalent (e.g., Google Cloud Platform, Azure) - Specific services detailed in Deployment Process.

### Software Development Tools

*   **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** VS Code with Python extension, or equivalent (e.g., PyCharm)
*   **Version Control:** Git (using GitHub or GitLab for repository hosting and collaboration)
*   **Package Management:** pip and conda (for managing Python dependencies)
*   **Documentation:** Markdown (for project documentation), Sphinx (potentially for API documentation)
*   **Collaboration:** Slack or equivalent (for team communication)
*   **Project Management:** Jira or equivalent (for task tracking and sprint management)

### Development Environment

The development environment will be based on individual developer workstations, utilizing virtual environments to isolate project dependencies.

*   **Operating System:** Linux, macOS, or Windows (with WSL2 for Linux compatibility)
*   **Python Version:** 3.9 or higher
*   **Virtual Environment Management:** `venv` or conda environments
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Sufficient RAM (16GB minimum recommended) and CPU power for training and running AI models. GPU acceleration (if available) is highly recommended for faster model training.

### Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be employed to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.

*   **Unit Tests:** Testing individual components and functions using `pytest` or `unittest`.
*   **Integration Tests:** Testing the interaction between different components, particularly the API endpoints and database interactions.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Testing the entire application workflow from the user interface to the backend services, potentially using Cypress or Selenium.
*   **Performance Tests:** Evaluating the application's performance under different load conditions, including response times and resource utilization.
*   **Security Tests:** Identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **RAG Specific Tests:** Evaluating the accuracy, relevance, and coherence of the chatbot's responses based on the Jarad knowledge base. This will involve creating a set of test questions and verifying that the chatbot provides correct and informative answers.

### Deployment Process

The deployment process will involve containerizing the application using Docker and deploying it to a cloud platform.

*   **Containerization:** Dockerize both the frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) applications.
*   **Image Repository:** Docker Hub or AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for storing Docker images.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s) or AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) for managing and scaling the containers.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for automating the provisioning of infrastructure resources.
*   **Load Balancing:** AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or equivalent for distributing traffic across multiple instances of the application.
*   **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch or equivalent for monitoring the application's performance and health.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** Automated deployment triggered by code changes in the Git repository.

**Example AWS Deployment Steps:**

1.  Build Docker images for the frontend and backend.
2.  Push the images to AWS ECR.
3.  Use Terraform or CloudFormation to provision the necessary infrastructure (ECS cluster, load balancer, database).
4.  Deploy the Docker containers to the ECS cluster.
5.  Configure the load balancer to route traffic to the containers.
6.  Set up monitoring using CloudWatch.

### Continuous Integration Approach

A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will be implemented to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.

*   **CI/CD Tool:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
*   **Automated Build Process:** Automatically build the application and run unit tests whenever code is pushed to the Git repository.
*   **Automated Testing:** Run integration and E2E tests as part of the CI pipeline.
*   **Automated Deployment:** Automatically deploy the application to a staging or production environment after the tests have passed.
*   **Code Quality Checks:** Integrate code linters and static analysis tools to enforce code quality standards.
*   **Version Control:** Use Git branching strategies (e.g., Gitflow) to manage code changes and releases.
