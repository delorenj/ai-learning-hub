## System Patterns

This document outlines the system patterns employed in the AI Learning Hub project. It covers architectural design, data models, API definitions, component structure, integration points, and scalability strategy.

### Architectural Design

The AI Learning Hub adopts a **Component-Based, Layered Architecture** with a **Micro-Frontend** approach for content sections.

*   **Component-Based:** The application is built from reusable components. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and testability. Components are designed with a single responsibility principle in mind.

*   **Layered Architecture:** The application is structured into distinct layers:
    *   **Presentation Layer (UI):** Responsible for rendering the user interface using React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui components. This layer interacts with the application layer through API calls.
    *   **Application Layer (Business Logic):** Contains the core business logic of the application, handling user requests, orchestrating data access, and enforcing business rules. This layer is primarily implemented in TypeScript.
    *   **Data Access Layer:** Provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the underlying data storage (e.g., database). This layer handles data retrieval, persistence, and transformation.
    *   **Infrastructure Layer:** Includes supporting services such as authentication, authorization, logging, and caching.

*   **Micro-Frontend (Content Sections):** The "How-To Guides" and "Tip-Snips" sections are treated as micro-frontends. This allows for independent development and deployment of these sections, improving team autonomy and release velocity. Each micro-frontend communicates with the backend API independently. We will use a strategy where they are served as separate Next.js pages within the main application, sharing the same core component library.

### Data Models

The core data models are defined below (using TypeScript-like syntax for clarity):

*   **HowToGuide:**

    ```typescript
    interface HowToGuide {
      id: string; // Unique identifier (UUID)
      title: string;
      slug: string; // URL-friendly title
      description: string;
      content: string; // Markdown or HTML content
      tags: string[]; // Array of tags for categorization
      createdAt: Date;
      updatedAt: Date;
      authorId: string; // Foreign key to User model
      published: boolean;
      featuredImage: string; // URL to featured image
    }
    ```

*   **TipSnip:**

    ```typescript
    interface TipSnip {
      id: string; // Unique identifier (UUID)
      title: string;
      slug: string; // URL-friendly title
      content: string; // Short tip content (Markdown or HTML)
      tags: string[]; // Array of tags for categorization
      createdAt: Date;
      updatedAt: Date;
      authorId: string; // Foreign key to User model
      published: boolean;
    }
    ```

*   **User:**

    ```typescript
    interface User {
      id: string; // Unique identifier (UUID)
      username: string;
      email: string;
      fullName: string;
      createdAt: Date;
      updatedAt: Date;
      role: 'admin' | 'author' | 'user';
    }
    ```

*   **Tag:**

    ```typescript
    interface Tag {
      id: string; // Unique identifier (UUID)
      name: string;
      slug: string; // URL-friendly name
    }
    ```

These models will be persisted in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and used throughout the application. The actual implementation will depend on the chosen database technology.

### API Definitions

The API follows a RESTful architecture, utilizing JSON for data exchange. The following are key API endpoints:

*   **`/api/how-to-guides`:**
    *   `GET`: Retrieves a list of how-to guides (supports pagination and filtering by tags).
    *   `POST`: Creates a new how-to guide (requires authentication and authorization).
*   **`/api/how-to-guides/{id}`:**
    *   `GET`: Retrieves a specific how-to guide by ID.
    *   `PUT`: Updates a specific how-to guide (requires authentication and authorization).
    *   `DELETE`: Deletes a specific how-to guide (requires authentication and authorization).
*   **`/api/tip-snips`:**
    *   `GET`: Retrieves a list of tip snips (supports pagination and filtering by tags).
    *   `POST`: Creates a new tip snip (requires authentication and authorization).
*   **`/api/tip-snips/{id}`:**
    *   `GET`: Retrieves a specific tip snip by ID.
    *   `PUT`: Updates a specific tip snip (requires authentication and authorization).
    *   `DELETE`: Deletes a specific tip snip (requires authentication and authorization).
*   **`/api/users`:**
    *   `POST`: Creates a new user account.
*   **`/api/auth/login`:**
    *   `POST`: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.
*   **`/api/auth/logout`:**
    *   `POST`: Invalidates the user's session.
*   **`/api/tags`:**
    *   `GET`: Retrieves a list of all tags.

All API endpoints will be secured using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and role-based authorization.

### Component Structure

The UI is built using reusable React components. Key components include:

*   **Layout:** Provides the overall page structure (header, footer, navigation).
*   **HowToGuideCard:** Displays a summary of a how-to guide.
*   **TipSnipCard:** Displays a tip snip.
*   **MarkdownRenderer:** Renders Markdown content (used for how-to guides and tip snips).
*   **TagList:** Displays a list of tags.
*   **Pagination:** Handles pagination of content lists.
*   **SearchBar:** Allows users to search for content.
*   **AuthForm:** Handles user authentication (login/registration).

These components are built using TailwindCSS for styling and shadcn/ui for pre-built UI elements, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface.  Higher-order components (HOCs) will be used for authentication and authorization checks.

### Integration Points

*   **Authentication/Authorization:** Integrates with an authentication provider (e.g., NextAuth.js) for user authentication and authorization.
*   **Database:** Connects to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to persist data.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Integrates with a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to serve static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript).
*   **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Integrates with SEO tools and techniques to improve search engine rankings.  This includes generating sitemaps, using semantic HTML, and optimizing page titles and meta descriptions.
*   **Analytics:** Integrates with an analytics platform (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel) to track user behavior.
*   **Image Hosting:** Integrates with an image hosting service (e.g., Cloudinary, AWS S3) to store and deliver images.

### Scalability Strategy

The application is designed for scalability through the following strategies:

*   **Stateless Architecture:** The application layer is designed to be stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling by adding more instances.
*   **Database Optimization:** The database will be optimized for performance through indexing, query optimization, and caching.
*   **Caching:** Caching will be implemented at various levels (e.g., browser caching, server-side caching) to reduce database load and improve response times.  Redis or Memcached may be used for server-side caching.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** A CDN will be used to distribute static assets globally, reducing latency for users in different geographic regions.
*   **Load Balancing:** A load balancer will be used to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application.
*   **Micro-Frontend Decoupling:** The micro-frontend architecture allows for independent scaling of the "How-To Guides" and "Tip-Snips" sections based on their individual traffic patterns.
*   **Database Sharding (If Needed):** For very large datasets, database sharding can be implemented to distribute data across multiple database servers.
