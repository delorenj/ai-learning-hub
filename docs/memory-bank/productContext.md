## Market Analysis

The market for AI education and development tools is experiencing rapid growth, driven by the increasing adoption of AI across various industries. There's a high demand for accessible and practical training that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Specifically, the following trends are observed:

*   **Increased demand for hands-on AI training:** Professionals and students are seeking practical experience in building and deploying AI solutions. Online courses and tutorials are plentiful, but often lack the immersive and collaborative environment needed for effective learning.
*   **Growing interest in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems:** RAG is becoming a popular approach for building AI-powered chatbots and knowledge bases. There's a need for tools and training that simplify the development and deployment of RAG systems.
*   **Rise of no-code/low-code AI platforms:** While powerful, many AI development tools require significant coding expertise. There's a growing demand for platforms that enable users with limited coding skills to build and deploy AI solutions.
*   **Focus on specific AI workflows:** Rather than general AI knowledge, users often seek training in specific AI workflows relevant to their industry or role, such as image recognition, natural language processing, or predictive analytics.
*   **Personalized learning paths:** Learners benefit from customized learning paths that cater to their individual skill levels and learning preferences.

## Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape includes a mix of online learning platforms, AI development tools, and consulting services. Key competitors include:

*   **Online Learning Platforms (Coursera, Udacity, edX, DataCamp):** These platforms offer a wide range of AI courses, but often lack the immersive and collaborative environment of a workshop.
*   **AI Development Tools (Google AI Platform, AWS SageMaker, Microsoft Azure Machine Learning):** These platforms provide powerful tools for building and deploying AI solutions, but can be complex and require significant coding expertise.
*   **RAG-specific platforms (Haystack, LangChain):** These tools are geared towards RAG and LLM implementations, but might not provide a comprehensive learning experience from the basics of AI.
*   **AI Consulting Services (Accenture, Deloitte, McKinsey):** These companies offer AI consulting services, including training and development, but are often expensive and focused on enterprise clients.
*   **Bootcamps and Intensive Workshops (General Assembly, Flatiron School):** These offer intensive, immersive learning experiences, but can be costly and time-consuming.

**Differentiation:** This project aims to differentiate itself by providing a comprehensive, immersive, and accessible AI development workshop experience that focuses on practical skills and real-world application. The inclusion of a RAG chatbot powered by Jarad's knowledge base provides a unique learning resource and a valuable project for participants to build. This project bridges the gap between traditional online courses and expensive consulting services by offering a hands-on, project-based learning experience at a reasonable cost.

## User Stories

*   As a **beginner with no prior AI experience**, I want to be guided through the basics of AI and machine learning, so I can understand the fundamental concepts and build a foundation for further learning.
*   As a **developer with some coding experience**, I want to learn how to build and deploy AI solutions using popular frameworks and tools, so I can apply AI to my projects and improve my skills.
*   As a **business professional with limited technical skills**, I want to understand how AI can be used to solve business problems and improve efficiency, so I can identify opportunities for AI implementation in my organization.
*   As a **data scientist**, I want to deepen my understanding of RAG and how it can be used to build knowledge-based applications, so I can build more sophisticated and intelligent systems.
*   As a **workshop participant**, I want to have access to a centralized hub where I can find all the necessary resources, code examples, and documentation, so I can easily navigate the workshop and complete the projects.
*   As a **workshop participant**, I want to be able to ask questions and get answers from a RAG chatbot powered by Jarad's knowledge base, so I can quickly find the information I need and avoid getting stuck.
*   As a **workshop participant**, I want to build a RAG chatbot as part of the workshop, so I can have a practical experience and see the application of RAG in real life.
