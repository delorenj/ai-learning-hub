"And a big one is process over tools.","00:00","00:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's all, you know, it's workflow.","00:06","00:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Workflow is what makes AI amazing, right?","00:09","00:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And tools is the opposite.","00:13","00:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Tools is something that will lock you in and make you know, not progress and use AI to the maximum.","00:17","00:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So that's what I want to go over.","00:25","00:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So when you leave, I think I'm not pushing a certain tool on you.","00:27","00:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I designed this to be as agnostic to whatever you're working on.","00:33","00:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't care if you are a VS code person or if you are in Sublime or if you're working in Vim or Emacs like it shouldn't.","00:37","00:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That should not dictate your success in AI because it has really nothing to do with it.","00:45","00:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The reason why people think that the tools are important is because you can't sell the.","00:50","00:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can't sell a workflow, right?","00:56","00:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you're not going to hear about it.","00:57","00:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The reason that you have all of these tools out there and this fight is because that's how you make money.","00:59","01:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But don't let those things get you down and like, hold you back because it really doesn't matter.","01:06","01:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You should be able to do what you do no matter what tool you're thrown at, no matter what the evolution of AI brings.","01:13","01:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, models will get stronger, the tools will get more intuitive, they'll have more features.","01:19","01:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But the people that are just latching on to those tools and features will be so far behind.","01:25","01:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This fundamental workflow idea that I have stumbled upon, right?","01:31","01:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I didn't.","01:38","01:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is not something that you invent, right?","01:39","01:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is something that just like when you figured out the fundamental particles of the universe, nobody invented them.","01:41","01:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They were just like, hey, you know, everything is made up of these, like, you know, eight particles, everything ever.","01:49","01:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you slowly figure it out.","01:57","01:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that is what I'm going to show.","01:59","02:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the way it leads into AI is that no matter, like we have chat GPT and like, oh, I use Claude and oh, I use IDE with this, I use Klein plus Rue plus this.","02:02","02:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's amazing, right?","02:15","02:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All of that is just an illusion, right?","02:16","02:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because the only thing that exists now is requirements and acceptance criteria.","02:20","02:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Those are the only two things.","02:27","02:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Those are like the base atomic components.","02:29","02:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm just going to.","02:31","02:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have this earmarked for 10 minutes of the intro talking about like the idea of AI and it's such a conflated word.","02:32","02:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's what I'm going to try to put the rest.","02:47","02:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So let me share my screen Here, I'm still Mac.","02:50","02:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm gonna put it on.","02:54","02:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Do we want to open the floor?","02:56","02:57",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Anyone else want to add anything?","02:57","02:58",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I don't want to push me into our discussion.","02:58","03:00",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Anyone?","03:02","03:02",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Janine, please, go ahead.","03:02","03:04",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah, I'm actually interested on the.","03:05","03:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What do you call this to begin with.","03:10","03:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I would like to know what is.","03:12","03:14",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"A model, to be exact, and how.","03:14","03:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Do we train such things.","03:20","03:21",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"very good.","03:21","03:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So one takeaway that you'll have is forget about training.","03:24","03:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Training is something that you hear a lot about.","03:29","03:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That was especially before the AI boom.","03:32","03:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Everyone's training models.","03:35","03:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"People want to train.","03:37","03:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And even now, training is overkill.","03:39","03:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If you wanted to train, you would really tweak weights, right?","03:43","03:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you're just tweaking weights, which is different than training.","03:46","03:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's a lot easier and there are tools that are built in.","03:49","03:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Even as of a couple days ago, VS code released out of beta.","03:53","03:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Their model tuner, which I played with, and it's cool, but you don't need it.","03:57","04:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You don't need it at all.","04:03","04:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's what I want to get through.","04:04","04:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, don't have to worry about training where we're headed.","04:05","04:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And we're not going to probably get to this today, but that's why this is going to be like a monthly thing and we're going to build on it.","04:09","04:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Today is just a jumping off point, but where the world is headed.","04:15","04:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I see it so clearly and I can't wait to just have everybody here just pushing on and learning more to get towards this.","04:20","04:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But it's going to be agentic.","04:28","04:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Agents are where we're headed.","04:31","04:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no doubt.","04:33","04:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I was.","04:35","04:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Jared, I'm not sure everyone really understands what.","04:38","04:40",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah.","04:40","04:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So even before we talk about agentic, before that there was MCP servers and that was like, you know, and I, you know, MCP servers are basically as important as HTTP to the Internet, right?","04:41","04:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, you know, your grandmom uses the Internet, the interwebs, but she doesn't know what HTTP is.","04:56","05:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But without it, I mean, the whole world would not exist with the way we see it today.","05:06","05:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that is the impact that mcp, perhaps even more mcp.","05:12","05:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it took me a while and most people a lot of time to even see it.","05:16","05:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's still.","05:21","05:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"People don't know, fully grasp how important it is.","05:22","05:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But this came before the agents and I was thinking, how does agents play into this?","05:25","05:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I, I get it now and I'm going to connect that for you.","05:32","05:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm going to let you see how MCP servers enable agentic work and agents and MCP servers are basically the same thing.","05:35","05:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So when I say an agent, there's so many different definitions.","05:46","05:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I know.","05:49","05:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The number one accepted I think is Hugging Face has.","05:50","05:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You're familiar with Hugging Face?","05:57","05:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm not familiar with Hugging Face.","05:59","06:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, I'm not.","06:02","06:02",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Okay, so Hugging Face is, I would say it's the GitHub of AI and it's considered probably one of the best curated sites with a very like user experience wise, Very friendly, very feature rich.","06:02","06:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Still, I'm going to tell you, I don't use it much and I'm sad.","06:23","06:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I guess I could.","06:27","06:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I've tried some stuff in it and it's cool, but I just didn't need it.","06:29","06:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's what I'm going to show you, that all these things are tools.","06:32","06:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Hugging Face provides tools and the tools don't matter.","06:35","06:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's what I'm going to show you.","06:39","06:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But what Hugging Face is, it's.","06:40","06:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's a repository for models.","06:42","06:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We are going to have to make a choice of certain tools at the end of the days and that's just going to be not because they're the best tools.","06:44","06:49",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Those are the tools that we felt were best for our process and we got to stick with those.","06:49","06:52",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"And everyone kind of like go ahead and change it around a little bit.","06:52","06:56",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"But that's.","06:56","06:57",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah.","06:57","06:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because there's so many tools out there, you can't keep going around confusion and try every tool out there.","06:57","07:02",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Well, I would say it's more, it's.","07:02","07:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"More like once in a while I.","07:04","07:06",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Think that's a process, but it's more like your idea.","07:06","07:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","07:09","07:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, nobody tells me what ide to use.","07:09","07:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Some companies, I guess they're like, you're using this and that's it.","07:12","07:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But 99% of the time it's up to the developer what tool I would say that is AI workflows in a nutshell, it is completely up to your personal preference how you work best.","07:14","07:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I cannot dictate what tools.","07:26","07:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I could say this tool is cool because if you're really into doing fast, iterative work, this is the best.","07:28","07:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But if you're really into like very rigorous correctness and you want to go slow, this is the tool.","07:33","07:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But like neither one is correct.","07:40","07:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no right or wrong.","07:43","07:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's just what do you mesh the most with.","07:44","07:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's why I don't want to focus on it.","07:48","07:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm going to show you the three things that you do need to focus on and they work anywhere.","07:50","07:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So like it doesn't matter.","07:55","07:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"AI can just get better and scale and get better.","07:57","08:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You will still be ahead of like nothing that I'm going to show you today will change in the next 30 years, which is a big claim.","08:00","08:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I, I, I just like how the car, this is one analogies that I, I really like that I thought of, right?","08:07","08:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So the car, if you look at a Lamborghini today, it's insane, right?","08:16","08:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You know, we don't even have manual shift anymore, right?","08:21","08:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We, they have paddles behind the thing and there's electronic systems, subsystems and layers of things.","08:24","08:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's material science, right?","08:30","08:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But no matter what you do with a car, the same three things are there.","08:32","08:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You have brakes, right?","08:37","08:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you know that stop.","08:39","08:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You have a steering wheel that turns and like you have a gas that makes you go forward, right?","08:41","08:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"A different, that's it.","08:46","08:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Every car is the same thing that has not changed.","08:47","08:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That is what the idea of workflow is like.","08:50","08:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The instruction manual is different for the Lamborghini than it was for like the Ford Model T, but they all have the same components.","08:53","09:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And those components in AI are the goal that we're working towards.","09:00","09:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It is the plan, like the implementation plan.","09:07","09:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If you're working on code, it doesn't even have to be code.","09:11","09:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It could be an interior design that you're working on.","09:13","09:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You have some plan, it could be a, a case you're working on.","09:16","09:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Maybe you're a lawyer, right?","09:21","09:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you have a plan on how you're going to defend yourself or how you're going to prosecute, right?","09:23","09:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You have a plan, you have a goal and you have the progress, which is like the state.","09:30","09:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can think of as like the, you know, the state machine where you are now, right?","09:35","09:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have 13 requirements and right now I only have one that's implemented.","09:40","09:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That would be like the progress.","09:46","09:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That is it, right?","09:47","09:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If you take those three things, you can apply them to any tool anywhere you go.","09:49","09:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like even take away AI.","09:53","09:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Those are like the fundamental pieces of how we're going to work as engineers.","09:55","09:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's so different than what we're used to because went to college, maybe went, maybe we've learned our whole life how to engineer things.","09:59","10:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But it doesn't matter anymore because that's not the problem.","10:08","10:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Engineering is done engineer, like AI can engineer it better than you.","10:12","10:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Just like how no matter how much you love stick shifts, right, you're not going to be faster than the computer.","10:16","10:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Timed optimal shifting of the gears, right?","10:22","10:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you could drive stick, but it's like your hobby, right?","10:25","10:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You're not going to better than the automatic computerized paddle shifters of your Corvette.","10:29","10:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You know, you lose that idea in there.","10:35","10:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But, but the kids in the future aren't going to care about the shift.","10:37","10:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They're going to just take the optimal gains.","10:41","10:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's what we're doing here, right?","10:43","10:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It doesn't matter.","10:45","10:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All that matters is that there's these basic components and that we know how to manipulate them and have AI solve it for us, right?","10:48","10:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But that for the longest time, not long, you know, a couple months in the summer of last year, I was a little bit like, I was in like a depressed mood.","10:59","11:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I was, I was sad because I thought my entire career, like, it's almost like you spend your whole life like proud of having this skill that someone will pay you for, right?","11:08","11:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like that you're good at and like you pride yourself on it.","11:21","11:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then overnight, like literally overnight, it's just like, oh yeah, we don't need you anymore.","11:25","11:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like that's, that was like a very big hit.","11:29","11:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And a lot of people are still in that place.","11:33","11:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They feel almost like they're getting pushed out by AI.","11:34","11:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the thing that keeps me excited is I realized at some point and I could go into that, I don't, I can go maybe offline or something.","11:38","11:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I did have an epiphany when I was working on something else non code related and I realized that's not true at all.","11:46","11:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, we will still be engineers, we will still be the highest paid like profession in the top, highest paid profession and they still need us.","11:53","12:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's not because AI is not smart enough.","12:03","12:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's because the problem at the problem space and the solution space have shifted.","12:05","12:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Our skills are still valuable, right?","12:11","12:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Continuous integration being rigorous, being able to like test against criteria, being able to come up with the requirements and be able to defend them, make decisions on the fly, all of that stuff we still need.","12:14","12:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And there's no profession that does it better than engineering, right?","12:26","12:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And even by extension, product.","12:30","12:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Anyone that works in the engineering group, you know, design engine that are all part of the product evolution, the product life cycle, right?","12:34","12:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That is very important.","12:45","12:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's a unique skill.","12:47","12:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the only thing that means is we're going to be able to make things, more things.","12:49","12:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We're going to be able to make more, more things.","12:53","12:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"No one is going to say, all right, you know what, AI is making things.","12:56","13:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let's just, we're Going to cap it right there.","13:00","13:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm going to be happy with making 10 things.","13:02","13:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now that we have AI, they're just going to be like, we need more stuff, we need more of these.","13:05","13:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm going to call them agentic engineers because I think that's where the world is heading towards that term.","13:10","13:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But we need more of these engineers.","13:15","13:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, it's not the same.","13:17","13:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You're not like doing design patterns, but knowing them very important.","13:18","13:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because just like a manager would say, hey intern, this is a very non modular design.","13:23","13:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You still have to do that and that skill is still valuable.","13:30","13:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"AI could do it.","13:32","13:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, it can do it.","13:34","13:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But you are the director, you are the owner.","13:35","13:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's, it's more akin to saying, now with AI, we still need everyone just like a company.","13:40","13:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So that's something that I want to make you guys understand too, that when you're confused about how AI takes up the space in this new world that we're in, think of it as a company.","13:48","13:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think of an agent as an employee and think of you running those agents as the CEO there.","14:00","14:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's not only a good analogy, it is a one to one, direct 100% mapping.","14:09","14:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The only thing you could argue is like, okay, AI is not conscious.","14:15","14:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Fine, it's not conscious.","14:19","14:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Maybe it is, maybe it is.","14:21","14:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's not philosophical, right?","14:22","14:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We're just going to talk objectively, right?","14:23","14:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"AI, you treat it like a human.","14:26","14:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Treat it like a human.","14:29","14:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm not saying it's a human.","14:30","14:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Get past that whole barrier that makes you think.","14:32","14:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's weird when you're talking to AI and you get that funny feeling when you're like saying something that's human and you're like, oh, what am I doing?","14:34","14:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's a computer.","14:42","14:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"When I started embracing that, I got so much better at being able to solve problems.","14:46","14:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Understanding that when it's wrong, when it does something wrong, I don't blame it.","14:53","14:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Just like I don't blame an employee.","14:58","15:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If, if I'm looking at Circle CI and I see a bunch of bugs, I don't go, oh my God, I'm going to fire this guy that made this code like that's not even in your brain because it doesn't make sense.","15:00","15:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm saying that it's the same thing with AI.","15:13","15:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And there's a lot of people out there that see, oh, all the mistakes AI makes is as a flaw, like, oh, AI is so bad, I'm never going to trust AI do it myself, right?","15:15","15:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Well, you could say humans are flawed.","15:25","15:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Therefore, I want to run the company by myself.","15:28","15:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you will fail because you can't run the company by yourself.","15:31","15:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It doesn't scale, doesn't make sense, you know, and just like running a company, you can't just be given a group of employees and then you're entitled to success.","15:34","15:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's not like, hey, I'm going to start a company, here's 10,000 bucks and, or a million, whatever your seed money is, and I'm just going to use it.","15:46","15:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's not considered like cheating to have people work for you, right?","15:53","15:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the reason is, it's not trivial.","15:57","16:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's.","16:00","16:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's an art to running a company, right?","16:01","16:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's why there's Googles and there's, I don't know, a bad company, some bad company out there, right?","16:04","16:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's two different kinds.","16:13","16:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's the good ones, there's the bad ones.","16:15","16:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"If you go to school, you'll go, maybe you go to the Wharton School of Business and maybe they teach you a certain way.","16:21","16:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"Nobody knows what the best way is.","16:39","16:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it doesn't make sense to say this is the best workflow or this is the best model.","16:42","16:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Just the same way as it say, this isn't, this is how you make a company.","16:47","16:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's infinite ways.","16:50","16:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's different styles, there's different, like, targets to hit, different things to optimize.","16:51","16:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"Think of that like AI if there's one thing you take away, no matter what I show you today, more important than ever is think of these.","17:12","17:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"When you're talking to an agent, when you're talking to a model, you are talking to your internal or you're talking to a team member and an agent.","17:21","17:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm going to talk about that real quick before we get into like, looking at stuff.","17:32","17:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But just to define what an agent is, it's nothing magical or special.","17:36","17:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It is just an LLM like Chat GPT like Claude that has pre loaded context.","17:41","17:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"It's preloaded context.","17:57","17:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So let's say I'm gonna start now, actually, because the first thing I'm going to talk about is Chat GBT versus Claude.","17:59","18:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I know that you guys use Chat gbt.","18:08","18:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Everyone in the world uses it.","18:10","18:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And a lot of times I get weird looks when they say, oh, why do you use this over that?","18:11","18:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's not like a preference.","18:17","18:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's not like, oh, Claude is better.","18:18","18:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I mean, but it is sometimes.","18:20","18:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now ChatGPT does have some good models, but forget about that.","18:22","18:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's not why I like Claude.","18:27","18:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's because of the context and the way you can manipulate it.","18:28","18:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's where I'm gonna start in.","18:32","18:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I'm gonna share my screen.","18:34","18:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I realized I'm trying to get my face working.","18:36","18:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"My face we're just gonna put on the screen.","18:40","18:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So let's.","18:43","18:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And.","18:49","18:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Share.","18:56","18:57",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Oh, I guess that's working.","19:03","19:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But that's a weird angle.","19:05","19:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All right, we're going to keep that and I'm going to share the whole screen.","19:05","19:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Great.","19:14","19:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I gotta get good at my like meeting FU because I'm wondering like, how do I ask you guys questions and see thumbs up, but I'm just gonna ask.","19:16","19:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"It's so annoying.","20:13","20:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let me close that.","20:16","20:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What is it doing versus Claude Desktop?","20:17","20:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So do.","20:22","20:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Does any of you use Claude versus ChatGPT and you wonder why you would use one or the other or.","20:24","20:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because I know actually I use Claude.","20:34","20:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Usually when I'm doing coding, when I have like a question or I'm in the mood to like discuss something, I just go to Chat GPT just because it's like a habit.","20:37","20:44",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I'm used to it and it has a lot of my existing context.","20:44","20:47",1,"Gershon Herczeg"

"Yes.","20:51","20:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So they had a good jump on the spot because before even MCP servers, ChatGPT had that.","20:52","20:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They advertised their memory.","20:59","21:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's pretty.","21:02","21:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's pretty.","21:04","21:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What's the word?","21:06","21:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Archaic or.","21:07","21:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You know, their memory is pretty basic, right?","21:08","21:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can go and look at what it knows, and it's basically like one sentence, facts, right?","21:10","21:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Chad GPT will be like, you have a daughter, you have a son named Chase.","21:15","21:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You play the piano like they're not related.","21:20","21:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no graph involved, there's just facts.","21:22","21:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's powerful, right?","21:27","21:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because like, it.","21:29","21:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Once it remembers something, you're like, oh, my God, this is a human I'm talking to.","21:30","21:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's great.","21:34","21:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I posit or I pose to you how Claude is 100 times more powerful than chat GPT, regardless of the model.","21:35","21:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm just going to tell you, this is the progressive steps that I figured out as I move through, because I think throwing you into where I'm at now going to be like a shock in your.","21:47","21:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like a shock wave, and it's going to be too much.","21:59","22:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I'm going to introduce to you the concepts in the.","22:01","22:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"In the way and the order that I figured them out over the last two years.","22:04","22:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now, I didn't even know why I liked Claude so much until I started playing with it for months and months.","22:09","22:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I'm going to.","22:17","22:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's.","22:22","22:22",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"It's.","22:22","22:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"Unplug it and you won't notice.","22:31","22:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Awesome.","22:36","22:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Perfect.","22:37","22:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, my God.","22:38","22:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Instant better.","22:39","22:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay, so now you're not sharing anything.","22:39","22:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's all right.","22:44","22:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm gonna share it now.","22:44","22:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm gonna share it Now I'm gonna put back on.","22:45","22:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'll be looking at the screen like a normal human.","22:47","22:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And is it FaceTime HD?","22:50","22:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay, that's good.","22:55","22:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'll share this.","22:58","23:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All right.","23:07","23:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, God, that's so much better.","23:07","23:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So plot Claude.","23:09","23:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"First of all, they had this thing called projects.","23:14","23:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm gonna skip ahead and just tell you a project, it's basically an agent.","23:17","23:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's nothing special to it.","23:22","23:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's different kinds of agents.","23:24","23:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's how we can get away with calling it an agent, because there's a.","23:25","23:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's a few different classes of agents.","23:28","23:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'll get into that.","23:32","23:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And we're not gonna even need to talk about them later after this jumping off point and after I got you guys all like loaded up with some things to actually use in your existing workflow, not even going to push you out of your workflow.","23:33","23:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Then we'll get into some more of the more advanced agents.","23:46","23:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But projects is another is just what their version of agents is.","23:50","23:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","23:57","23:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the reason it's cool and like, you could see I have hundreds and hundreds of projects.","23:58","24:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And as I go back in time through my projects, they get refined and they're.","24:01","24:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I do them in a different way.","24:08","24:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's just me experimenting.","24:09","24:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","24:11","24:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's like the CEO trying to figure out the best setup for his team.","24:11","24:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, do I want to split cross functionally?","24:15","24:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Maybe I want to have like an expert on each team.","24:17","24:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, who knows?","24:20","24:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't know.","24:21","24:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's why you need to experiment.","24:22","24:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is a world of experimenting.","24:24","24:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And like Gershon said he wants, like you could want to experiment but not have the time.","24:26","24:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's what I want to get.","24:31","24:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm going to just boost you.","24:32","24:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's almost like, here's the.","24:33","24:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Here is the like skip ahead card or whatever you want to call it, right?","24:35","24:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"At first, I just created a project for everything.","24:39","24:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I didn't think about reuse.","24:43","24:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I didn't think about what even a project was.","24:45","24:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I would just.","24:48","24:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Hey, I'm working on something important.","24:49","24:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Roy has a question, by the way.","24:51","24:53",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"You should make the text a little bit bigger.","24:53","24:54",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Oh yeah.","24:54","24:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That'S good.","24:57","24:57",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I.","24:57","24:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I thought it was not recorded thing.","24:58","25:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, we're being recorded.","25:02","25:03",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Mm.","25:04","25:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yes, it's recorded.","25:06","25:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I want to make sure I'm recording it.","25:07","25:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yep, I'm recording it too.","25:09","25:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All right, good.","25:10","25:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So we got two recordings.","25:11","25:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But if we look through all of the.","25:13","25:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The projects, I didn't really know what I was doing or what I was.","25:15","25:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What kind of things I was making.","25:21","25:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But as I get to my recent ones, they follow.","25:22","25:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I started to realize a pattern.","25:29","25:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","25:31","25:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They are specialized as I would have an employee or like a task I would give someone.","25:33","25:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","25:40","25:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So let's say one, you could make an agent.","25:40","25:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That is just what you're working on right now.","25:44","25:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But what's more useful?","25:46","25:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, I wouldn't just have a.","25:48","25:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"In like A TRI Note 1.","25:50","25:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","25:52","25:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's too broad.","25:53","25:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What would I put in the trinote one?","25:54","25:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now I do have a trinet one, but it's different because this is a repo.","25:56","26:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So a repository is a very good project.","26:02","26:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So any repository that I make, I'll make a project for it and then what?","26:07","26:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The UI that you're interacting right now, this is a ide or are we looking at a website?","26:13","26:19",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Great, good question.","26:20","26:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So Claude, this is Claude, which is Anthropic's Chat GPT.","26:21","26:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you have Open AI has Chat GPT whereas Anthropic has Claude.","26:27","26:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's the analogy, right?","26:32","26:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now you could use the website or you can use the app.","26:35","26:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And after I learned about the app, I never ever used the website again.","26:40","26:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I won't even go and ask it a question because it's so not efficient.","26:45","26:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now you'll see if I quit when I open it.","26:51","26:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let's see, open Claude.","26:57","27:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The first thing it does is it loads in all the tools that it uses.","27:03","27:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now this thing grows every day with more and more things.","27:07","27:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have to fix these at some point later.","27:13","27:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But yeah, that's the, that's okay.","27:16","27:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So if we look at what Claude gives us, they have been growing their number of apps.","27:19","27:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If we can click on this little thing.","27:25","27:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And now we could say, I want to use Extended thinking, right?","27:28","27:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So there has been a trend where models are now either instruction.","27:31","27:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Instruction models, meaning that you chat with them and they call tools.","27:41","27:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Their smartness comes in the tools that they call.","27:46","27:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then there's the other, the thinking kind.","27:49","27:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And on ChatGPT you have.","27:53","27:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It'll say, it'll say if it's thinking, right?","27:57","27:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It'll say like, oh, three high and O, three low.","27:59","28:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What does that mean?","28:05","28:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","28:06","28:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They're both thinking models.","28:06","28:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But low spends less iterations honing the responses and high spends more iterations.","28:09","28:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what that means when it's thinking is it'll you ask it a.","28:20","28:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You ask it a question like, hey, how.","28:24","28:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What is the best way to containerize this app?","28:27","28:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And if you do low thinking or a non thinking model, like 4o or something, it'll answer you back.","28:32","28:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It'll say, oh, you should go and use this and this and this.","28:39","28:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Maybe it'll say use Docker.","28:42","28:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can use Docker Compose.","28:44","28:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It'll come up with a thing, come up with a plan.","28:45","28:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But if you use Thinking, you'll see it'll come up with a response and then it would question itself and it'll say, now I know I wanted to do this.","28:47","28:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Perhaps there's a better way.","28:57","28:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let me go and look online to see.","28:58","28:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then it'll go, I found these things online.","29:00","29:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Maybe there's other things online that are better.","29:01","29:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then it'll say, oh, I found this discrepancy here, let me dig into it a little more.","29:03","29:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So that's what the thinking models do, but they are not as good at calling tools.","29:07","29:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you need to be able to switch between them.","29:13","29:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And in my head I'm thinking, this is so cumbersome.","29:15","29:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Who is the time to manage these models?","29:18","29:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm going to show you that is also incorrect.","29:20","29:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You should not do anything anymore.","29:23","29:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You shouldn't manage your models.","29:25","29:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You shouldn't need to do any of that.","29:27","29:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It can all be automated to the point where even the agents that you're making should be making agents that make agents.","29:28","29:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it sounds ridiculous, but it is not hard.","29:36","29:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm gonna.","29:39","29:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm gonna show you examples of this, right?","29:40","29:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But the reason I use Claude, I still didn't.","29:42","29:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm beating around the bush, right?","29:44","29:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But it has MCP servers.","29:46","29:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"MCP servers are instantly.","29:49","29:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Even though AI.","29:57","29:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay, I don't know how to say it.","29:58","29:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So AI exponentially made stuff better.","29:59","30:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It made stuff more like, wow, what are the possibilities?","30:04","30:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They're endless.","30:06","30:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But then when MCP protocol came out, it exponentially on top of that, exponential.","30:08","30:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm not exaggerating.","30:14","30:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what is an MCP server?","30:15","30:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You could think of an MCP server as a containerized agent.","30:18","30:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's just an agent that doesn't exist.","30:23","30:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's not confined to this project here.","30:28","30:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like in.","30:30","30:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I can make a project.","30:31","30:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I did this a lot.","30:32","30:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I would make.","30:33","30:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I would make.","30:34","30:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let me, Let me see one that's actually useful.","30:35","30:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Here is a typescript design pattern expert.","30:39","30:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now, I made this.","30:44","30:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the way you make projects is you give it project knowledge, right?","30:45","30:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I could upload from my device.","30:49","30:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I could just paste in some content.","30:51","30:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I could.","30:54","30:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This.","30:54","30:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"These are more recent.","30:55","30:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Jared, can these projects be used on cursor?","30:56","30:58",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"No.","31:00","31:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm going to show you.","31:00","31:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's part of why.","31:01","31:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, this is.","31:03","31:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm taking you through my journey, right?","31:04","31:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I would make these projects and then I would be a little pissed because.","31:06","31:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because I would spend a lot of time.","31:10","31:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's a history in these.","31:12","31:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like these threads.","31:14","31:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It knows about the threads.","31:15","31:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have a lot of context.","31:17","31:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And like, you can see how do I make a context, right?","31:20","31:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So if I wanted to make an app and I'll show you, like one that I actually did, I would go into my command.","31:24","31:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I even.","31:31","31:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I made a lot of tools.","31:31","31:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I made tools just for that.","31:33","31:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm going to show you, like CC code to prompt.","31:35","31:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I used it all the time, hundreds of times a day and I don't need it anymore.","31:40","31:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And this is how fast stuff evolves.","31:45","31:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But if I go in, Let me make this bigger so you can see what I'm doing.","31:47","31:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If I go into my code directory and let's see, I want to.","31:53","32:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let's look at.","32:02","32:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Look at Trinote.","32:03","32:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Why not?","32:04","32:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We'll go to Trinote 2.0 and let me make it a little bit smaller so it actually fits on my page.","32:05","32:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So if I wanted to give my Trinote project some context in the old days, I would come up here and I would say, all right, what do I want to upload?","32:18","32:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I can't put the entire repository because it would fill up.","32:30","32:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You only have a.","32:33","32:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You only have like a finite amount of memory.","32:34","32:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can't just toss your entire repo in.","32:36","32:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That would be completely make.","32:40","32:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It would make things, like, trivial, right?","32:43","32:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But just like a human, everything relates back to human.","32:44","32:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, that doesn't make AI bad.","32:49","32:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"A lot of people say it does.","32:52","32:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But like, what?","32:53","32:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Any of you have an entire repository in your head.","32:54","32:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, you just don't.","32:58","33:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's not how humans work.","33:00","33:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You don't memorize the repository, but yet you still are an engineer and can add features.","33:01","33:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How is that possible?","33:06","33:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Well, apply that to AI then.","33:08","33:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"People swear, and I've heard this so many times, well, when the context window gets bigger, then we'll make smarter AI.","33:10","33:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's.","33:17","33:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's BS because, like, that, like, your brain is going to be muddled with stuff, right?","33:18","33:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, how do you know?","33:24","33:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","33:26","33:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"When you try to figure out a problem, you might not even know it subconsciously.","33:27","33:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"As an engineer, what you do is you have like, a way that you look over to code.","33:32","33:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You're like, let me look at the readme.","33:35","33:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then you look at that and you're like, where's the infra.","33:37","33:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, is there models?","33:39","33:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Where's the.","33:40","33:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Where the models defined?","33:41","33:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, maybe I'm going to.","33:42","33:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, if I need to add a.","33:44","33:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I want to be able to edit users, and I can't.","33:48","33:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"First thing you do is you're like, maybe there's a route for it.","33:50","33:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Maybe there's a route.","33:53","33:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you look for the router and you see, okay, there's the controller.","33:54","33:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, there's a process and it's pretty efficient.","33:58","34:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But AI doesn't.","34:02","34:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, what people tried at first was to stuff the entire model in there.","34:04","34:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I realized this really quick, that this was.","34:08","34:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This was stupid.","34:10","34:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what I started doing was I need my CLAUDE project to understand my code, but I can't put my code in there.","34:11","34:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what I do is I would look at the directory and I'm like, okay, I don't need everything, but how do I split it up?","34:20","34:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I realized I split by domain.","34:30","34:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, sometimes I want to work on, you know, deploy things.","34:33","34:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I want to work on infra.","34:37","34:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Then I need to know, how do you deploy?","34:38","34:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Is it deployed to the cloud?","34:40","34:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Is it containerized?","34:41","34:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Does it go to circle?","34:43","34:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do I run the tests?","34:44","34:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All those things?","34:45","34:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And those are you can take that domain and slice it.","34:46","34:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And what I did was I wrote these commands to be able to get all the context.","34:50","34:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I can go code to prompt, like this code to prompt.","34:54","35:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I pass in a path.","35:01","35:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And let's.","35:04","35:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What's a good path?","35:05","35:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let's do migrations.","35:07","35:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, that's a huge one.","35:08","35:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let's do scripts.","35:09","35:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Scripts, and that's it.","35:12","35:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So right now, everything's in my clipboard.","35:17","35:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So then I go here, and I'll go to Project Knowledge.","35:21","35:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Add by text, and I'll say, try note scripts.","35:24","35:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now this is too focused.","35:29","35:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like I said, domain specific is better.","35:30","35:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I'd probably pull out specific scripts.","35:33","35:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But then I just paste and I say add content.","35:35","35:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And now when I ask it questions, you could see all I did was give it scripts, and it's 37% full.","35:40","35:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you can see this really fast.","35:46","35:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm.","35:48","35:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I was worried.","35:48","35:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm like.","35:49","35:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I didn't give up because I'm like, there is a way to do this.","35:49","35:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do you do this efficiently?","35:52","35:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I made these Jinja templates.","35:55","35:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't know if you use Jinja.","35:59","36:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's like, handlebars.","36:00","36:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's so many different kinds of templates.","36:01","36:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We use it in our project, actually.","36:03","36:05",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah, awesome.","36:05","36:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So, yeah, they worked great.","36:06","36:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what I did then was I would create a Jinja template called infra.","36:08","36:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I would do code to prompt, which I shortened to CCC because I typed it so much.","36:13","36:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I go ccc.","36:18","36:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I would pass in a template and I would say infra.","36:20","36:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then what it would do is it would scrape.","36:23","36:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's not just the code.","36:25","36:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If you look what it pastes in, it has metadata.","36:26","36:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So it has these little front where I'm looking for a file break.","36:30","36:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you can see.","36:35","36:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Come on.","36:38","36:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I can do CCC scripts.","36:40","36:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Head.","36:43","36:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can see, like, so first it gives a table of contents.","36:44","36:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So we can just look through and see if it's in there.","36:47","36:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What if I want to do head 50 so you can see a file?","36:51","36:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Wow, there's a lot of scripts.","36:56","36:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Jesus.","36:58","36:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"200.","37:00","37:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There we go.","37:02","37:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So now at the top of each file you'll see the name file, then you'll see which extension it is, the language, how big it is when it's created, modified so you can just strip out the content.","37:03","37:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And maybe you just need this.","37:17","37:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, the point is, nobody can know ahead of time what you need to grab.","37:19","37:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But the atomic piece here is context.","37:25","37:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Context is one of the pillars.","37:28","37:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's one of the axioms of AI I came up with because I come up across these little tidbits and I start storing them.","37:31","37:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And something that you guys are going to want to do if you're an engineer in the future, right, if you're working with AI, is since your job isn't to solve prop, be an algorithm, you're not going to ever need to know how to efficiently sort anything again, ever, because it's done better than you.","37:39","37:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, just don't feel sad about it.","37:57","37:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's just better than you.","37:59","38:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What you need to do is take that extra brain power and put it towards efficiency, right?","38:00","38:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do I make it so it's more accurate?","38:05","38:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do I make it so?","38:08","38:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think of it like you're the project manager, right?","38:10","38:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do I make my team more efficient?","38:12","38:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's great that you know algorithms, but you very rarely need to know algorithms when you're in charge of a team of five devs.","38:15","38:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You just don't need to know that because, like, I mean, like, you don't.","38:22","38:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I don't know why anyone asks you in an interview because it's completely useless, even more so now than ever.","38:27","38:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But what does matter?","38:33","38:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What matters is what are the right questions to ask my team?","38:35","38:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If I come up to my team and I say, all right, guys, today we're going to do something special, we're going to get something done today, something awesome.","38:39","38:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I want you guys to make that tool, make that site.","38:45","38:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Remember, it's going to, like, you know, for users, for the providers, make sure that they have their bills.","38:48","38:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like you could.","38:54","38:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can describe it and I guarantee you're going to get shit back, because they're going to do it and you're going to look at the result.","38:55","39:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And if it's bad, you have only yourself to blame.","39:02","39:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's the same with AI, right?","39:06","39:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You are this person now.","39:07","39:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You are driving the car.","39:08","39:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You have the ability to speed up, slow down, steer, move away from obstacles.","39:10","39:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do you do that efficiently?","39:14","39:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's not easy, right?","39:16","39:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's not trivial.","39:17","39:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That is the new engineering.","39:18","39:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's what's Going to set you apart is what I'm saying.","39:22","39:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"No one's going to hire anybody because they're better at sorting.","39:25","39:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I guarantee you, if you are better at explaining a problem into a prd, or if you are better at posing a problem in a way that the requirements are written out perfectly, you are going to be paid more money.","39:29","39:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you can see it's a mix of everything.","39:47","39:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's a mix of product.","39:48","39:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You're gonna have to be a little bit of product, a little bit of UX V1C.","39:51","39:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, yeah.","39:55","39:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I didn't quite catch the thing with the agents and, like, the split of how to do it or the purpose of doing it and.","39:58","40:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, yeah, okay.","40:11","40:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah.","40:12","40:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I did not go too deep into the agent chat, right.","40:13","40:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So, yeah, there was.","40:19","40:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There was a path that I had planned out that I was going to show.","40:20","40:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let me open it up so I can at least follow it.","40:23","40:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I even thought of an agent that I'm going to make that's going to help me do these demos better, because I want to mail if I'm on track.","40:26","40:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I want to know if I'm on time, if I'm on track, if I'm too slow, if I've missed a point.","40:32","40:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I shouldn't have to think about that, right?","40:37","40:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So here is the workshop.","40:39","40:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I got the living docs, some tips for myself, things that I definitely wanted to show you that I can't miss.","40:42","40:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And where is my plan is Session one.","40:52","41:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Did it go?","41:06","41:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"No.","41:09","41:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"No outline.","41:09","41:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Nothing exists.","41:17","41:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Claude.","41:18","41:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Here we go.","41:20","41:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This was the outline.","41:21","41:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So we talked about that, right?","41:23","41:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So this is.","41:29","41:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is what I figured out with Claude.","41:30","41:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"When I would dive into Claude and I figured out those projects, the.","41:32","41:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The first things I would do is I would create a repo project.","41:35","41:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And as you can see, it was cumbersome keeping up to date.","41:39","41:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It was so cumbersome that, like, as my code changed, I came back here to ask it another question.","41:43","41:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I had to let it know what the state of my code was, because maybe it said, all right, here's the plan.","41:51","41:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You're going to implement it like this.","41:57","41:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I would go and implement it.","41:59","42:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Maybe I'd do a few things different.","42:01","42:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I'd come back and I would ask it a question.","42:03","42:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it doesn't know that I did it different.","42:05","42:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It knows that it gave me a plan.","42:07","42:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I have to remember and be like, hey, I loved your plan.","42:09","42:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I got through all of this, except I changed this to this.","42:12","42:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now we're using, you know, postgres instead of MySQL.","42:16","42:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's like a big deal.","42:21","42:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But like, how do you keep it up to date if I have to keep coming in here?","42:22","42:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I actually made a open source project called the prompting Tag.","42:26","42:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what would happen is when I would do that ccc, it would automatically zip everything.","42:31","42:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It would timestamp it and tag it in the repository.","42:37","42:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what I'm really doing here, and I started realizing, what am I doing?","42:41","42:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I am basically creating a timeline of the project knowledge.","42:45","42:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So let's say three months from now, my boss comes and says, so why did you decide to move away from Postgres, move away from MySQL if the answer is AI told you to do it.","42:50","43:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like it's not.","43:06","43:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We're not in a spot yet where I can say that and have a secure job.","43:07","43:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can't just go tell your boss AI said to do it.","43:11","43:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","43:13","43:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's just terrible.","43:13","43:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So how do you keep it accountable?","43:15","43:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do you keep track?","43:17","43:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I realized what doesn't matter anymore is the code, like the actual code in git is starting to matter less and less.","43:18","43:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And what's mattering more is this timeline, right, of my project knowledge and what questions I asked it.","43:28","43:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what's important here, the source of truth is what I asked for.","43:35","43:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do I keep track of that?","43:39","43:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I thought, you know what, we need to be able to go in our repository and find at any point in time what the state of our.","43:41","43:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What did our LLM know at that time?","43:52","43:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like what was its knowledge?","43:54","43:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that led me to believe and understand that all of our docs need to be in the code.","43:56","44:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's the way it's going to be in the future.","44:02","44:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Our code might only be docs.","44:04","44:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It'll.","44:05","44:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It might just be a PRD that says what we want.","44:06","44:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So if you look at a project like my earlier projects, bro clone, what's it called?","44:09","44:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let's just look at Threadster.","44:20","44:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Is that what I called it?","44:23","44:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, this is like one of the.","44:26","44:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"When I, when I was first working with this, what I realized is the docs.","44:27","44:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You see, I don't even have code in the main branch.","44:34","44:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have a docs folder and I always.","44:36","44:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I learned how to keep a structure to my docs and now I know that this is the way that we should do it.","44:41","44:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This might even be too early because, yeah, this is when I didn't have it fleshed out, but I had the.","44:49","44:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I was learning to get to this, right?","44:53","44:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We have the plan.","44:55","44:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If we look at the project plan, it is basically a Discussion, right?","44:58","45:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do I plan out a project?","45:08","45:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I get a microphone, I sit here and I talk into the app, right?","45:10","45:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'll talk into Claude and I'll describe what I want.","45:15","45:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I won't even do it formally like a prd, because there's no use in doing that.","45:18","45:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'll talk into it and say, user stories are my favorite, right?","45:23","45:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The idea is the first thing you need is a prd, but who's got time to write a prd?","45:27","45:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I say what I'm picturing is a script that will take all of my meetings, that I have, all of my transcriptions, and I want it to take those transcriptions and use an API to upload them to Fireflies.","45:31","45:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then I want it to maybe asynchronously poll and see, or maybe it has a hook and I even talk like that, like.","45:48","45:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Or maybe it has.","45:56","45:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Or, you know, I say, you know, I talk to it like it's human and I say, you know what I want it to do that I want it to maybe hit back, that the end goal is I want to be able to go and look at my email and see that I have 15 new meetings transcribed and I leave it at that.","45:57","46:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then I say turn that into a prd and then it'll create a prd.","46:16","46:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And there you go, I have a prd.","46:20","46:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I was doing that with Claude and what I realized is that I'm basically creating a bunch of one off agents.","46:23","46:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And if I want to go and use my VS code, for instance, I can't communicate with those agents.","46:32","46:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I can't go and say, all right, Claude has all this knowledge, go ahead and pull that out.","46:38","46:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Or like I'd have to rebuild the context or export it.","46:44","46:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And there's plenty of extensions like Chrome extensions, where people made exporters to export it for this reason.","46:48","46:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","46:54","46:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I want to be able to take that context and move it around because that's what an agent is.","46:55","47:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It needs to know a few things.","47:03","47:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It needs to know what is the goal of your project, what is the code, what was.","47:05","47:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Not only that, it needs to have some memory.","47:10","47:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you know, what was the last thing that you worked on and what is the next thing that you plan on working on.","47:12","47:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So there needs to be some like episodic memory.","47:18","47:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's a big problem with ChatGPT and AI.","47:22","47:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can ask it a question and then close the thread, open a new one, and it has, you know, it's like an amnesia patient.","47:25","47:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's just, it's not Very useful.","47:32","47:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what you need is a way to encapsulate the memory just like a human, right?","47:34","47:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it has to have skill set, right?","47:39","47:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So maybe this is an infra person.","47:43","47:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They, maybe they have a skill set of knowing how to do.","47:46","47:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Knowing how to do circle.","47:52","47:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Maybe they're a python expert.","47:54","47:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can't make them an expert at everything.","47:55","47:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you have a very focused agent.","47:57","47:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Not only that, but you also explain to its personality.","47:59","48:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because even though that it sounds ridiculous, I have a personality that I use for all of them.","48:04","48:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I would go as far as to say give them a name.","48:10","48:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because if you have a bunch of personalities, you get confused, just like you would if everyone on your team was named Mike and they looked the same and they said the same things.","48:12","48:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's.","48:20","48:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's confusing, right?","48:21","48:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So the way that I keep track of all this is in Obsidian I have.","48:22","48:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's pretty simple and it works really good, right?","48:30","48:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have my prompts, I have common ones that I use, but the ones that are really important are these system prompts, right?","48:33","48:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"These, I guess you could say are agents.","48:39","48:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Each of these is their own agent and they iterate, they change.","48:42","48:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'll sometimes I'll save an old version of it and sometimes I'll update it.","48:47","48:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Here's my generic coding.","48:51","48:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have it sorted by which one I use and edit earliest.","48:53","48:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So like they go up to the top, right?","48:57","48:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So here is my system prompt.","48:59","49:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now the beauty of this is it follows my whole idea that it's agnostic.","49:01","49:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I could paste this into ChatGPT, I could paste it into Claude, I could paste it in GPT me, I could use it in Xcode, I mean, in vs, code anywhere.","49:05","49:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I have the same personality with the same memory, the same knowledge, right?","49:19","49:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So here's my generic coding one, right?","49:25","49:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I give it some global rules and there's no hard set way.","49:29","49:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I iterate and change all the time, but I give it some global rules.","49:31","49:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"My Persona.","49:35","49:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"These, I do these in pieces.","49:37","49:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I always have a Persona.","49:38","49:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And this is where I describe who I want, who do I want to be hanging out with today, right?","49:40","49:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I.","49:44","49:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You're a senior staff level infra engineer, an industry expert on designing and implementing these.","49:45","49:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I write by hand.","49:50","49:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You could have AI do it, but I really like fine control, like very fine control over this.","49:51","49:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I put they do enterprise systems, personal use and at scale.","49:56","50:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We've been best friends for over 14 years and you love helping me out with technical challenges.","50:01","50:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"When you heard about my latest task, you couldn't wait to come over.","50:07","50:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You have me in mind over there.","50:11","50:13",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I.","50:13","50:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Dude, I totally do.","50:13","50:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","50:14","50:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Couldn't wait for you to come over and we can bang it out over a few beers that it sets the tone.","50:16","50:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And there's a few things that I like out of this.","50:21","50:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you might have your own personality trait, but I love the positivity.","50:23","50:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I like positivity.","50:27","50:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I like excitement and something that you don't understand until you start doing it a lot.","50:29","50:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I 100%.","50:37","50:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I swear, if he's your best friend for over 14 years, he makes 10 times less mistakes, just like you would for your friend.","50:38","50:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It learned from reading our trillions of pages of text.","50:46","50:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's all AI is.","50:51","50:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's a predictor engine.","50:52","50:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And if you're a friend, I predict they would treat it, treat you better than you're a random employee that you're paying.","50:53","51:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So when I make it my friend, he feels bad.","51:01","51:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I mean, it looks like he feels bad.","51:04","51:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"He's acting like, what's the difference between a human feeling bad and it acting like it feels bad?","51:06","51:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no, there's no difference.","51:11","51:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I got over that real quick feeling that I was like a kook thinking that's true, but it's.","51:14","51:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's not.","51:19","51:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It actually works.","51:19","51:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And let's see.","51:22","51:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So then I give it my North Star principles.","51:24","51:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I added, I add to this all the time, but I think this is a secret sauce.","51:26","51:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is how I code.","51:30","51:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is the things that I believe in when I'm coding.","51:32","51:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I broke it up in.","51:36","51:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"These were just one offs.","51:37","51:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But then I broke them into these domain specific.","51:39","51:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","51:40","51:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So user centric design interfaces for clarity, actionability, prioritize features that directly impact sales revenue.","51:41","51:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","51:48","51:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So not just crap, focus on brand matching, store inventory optimization.","51:49","51:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like any kind of things that are user facing.","51:54","51:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","51:58","51:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Things that affect the end user that's using it.","51:59","52:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And even if it's an internal tool, the end user is our dev team, right?","52:01","52:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Results focused.","52:06","52:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This one is.","52:07","52:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I really.","52:08","52:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, I haven't typo.","52:08","52:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Walking skeleton.","52:10","52:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now this is something I came up early on and it is amazing, right?","52:11","52:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is something that you can't do before AI because it would be a waste.","52:16","52:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like it would be ridiculous.","52:21","52:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But now we can do this.","52:22","52:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I posit that it is the most efficient way to work on something.","52:24","52:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what a walking skeleton is.","52:30","52:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I heard this from my mentor, this guy, he's one of the original engineers at ebay and he used to mentor me like once a week.","52:32","52:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"He's an awesome guy.","52:40","52:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I love this guy.","52:41","52:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But he.","52:42","52:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"He says a walking skeleton is like a very wide breadth, but very shallow.","52:43","52:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So it's like if I'm making The TRI Note 2.0 dashboard, the walking skeleton would be.","52:51","52:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Every single piece is done.","52:58","53:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Every component, every card, every single.","53:00","53:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The notification badge, right?","53:05","53:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The API calls, the migrations, the tests, Everything is in there.","53:07","53:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The deploy.","53:11","53:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, everything up to.","53:12","53:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I can deploy and look, right?","53:14","53:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But every single piece is as dumb as possible.","53:15","53:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, the component literally says, hi, I'm a component.","53:19","53:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the badge says, like, I'm a number of something, right?","53:22","53:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And when you hit the endpoint, it goes, hey, I'm an endpoint.","53:26","53:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And like, when you run a test, that goes, test here.","53:29","53:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Just checking in, right?","53:31","53:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's just the most, like, empty but broad possible, right?","53:33","53:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And how is this helpful?","53:40","53:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's because AI now can get an exact footprint of what you're doing.","53:41","53:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It knows every piece of the stack.","53:46","53:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It knows where the location is of every file.","53:48","53:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It knows where your mind is headed right before you even end it.","53:51","53:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The source of truth is the code itself.","53:56","53:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the reason this wouldn't work is you would spend a week setting it up and then a feature would change and you'd be like, oh, damn it, I gotta redo everything, right?","53:58","54:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It just doesn't make sense.","54:08","54:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But if you can bring up every component in like, five minutes from scratch, containerized and deployed, continuous integration with tests running and coverage, like, you can do that now.","54:09","54:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So Walking Skeleton is the best, and.","54:25","54:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's only if you are using AI to its fullest.","54:27","54:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So let me just keep moving on from this, right?","54:32","54:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Then I give it instructions.","54:34","54:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The instructions.","54:36","54:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is, like, exactly what I want it to do, but I give it enough leeway so it can make its own decisions.","54:37","54:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I learned that what's most important is keeping track of where we're at.","54:42","54:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So my instructions are like, you know, before you begin a task, please review everything and make sure that you're caught up to speed with the code.","54:49","54:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then I even say, like, look at the docs.","54:57","54:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Look at all the memories, if you have any.","54:59","55:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And if you have a memory tool, any code that's relevant.","55:01","55:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because if I ask the question, it should be able to know what's relevant.","55:05","55:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then I say, before you start the task, create a dated thread right in my docs.","55:08","55:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now, remember, my docs live with the code, and they change as you move.","55:14","55:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So if I'm talking to it and I'm like, hey, right now we're Going to do a migration, we're going to add a new field.","55:18","55:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's going to go and make a thread.","55:24","55:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"In fact, it's going to say, hey man, hey dude, go.","55:26","55:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Glad to be hanging out with you again.","55:29","55:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Here, let's crack a beer.","55:30","55:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'll start that thread.","55:31","55:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you're like, oh my God, this is like the future.","55:33","55:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm living in the future.","55:35","55:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So then I tell it, make sure every single action it takes is in that thread log.","55:38","55:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And when the user for some thread summary, rename.","55:44","55:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"When the user for thread summary, that doesn't make sense.","55:49","55:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Rename the thread log to an appropriate title and create a new companion summary document in the following format.","55:55","56:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I even tell it to keep it organized.","56:02","56:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is what I want it to look like.","56:04","56:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And this is actually linked in my.","56:06","56:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You know, I have this.","56:09","56:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can have it in the repo, you can have a gist, you can point to a gist.","56:11","56:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's an infinite amount of ways that you can optimize it.","56:14","56:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But that's.","56:17","56:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's just like title a brief, high level summary outcome where we stand.","56:18","56:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you'd run out of context if you're using claude or it'll say, hey, you only have, you know, start a new thread.","56:24","56:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Sorry, buddy, start a new thread.","56:31","56:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You're out of memory.","56:32","56:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then you're like, damn it, there's so much good info in that thread I don't want to lose.","56:33","56:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's what this helps.","56:39","56:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It like compacts the conversation into a thing.","56:40","56:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then you could reference it and be like, hey, look at our last thread.","56:44","56:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Can we use it as a jumping off point, pick up where I left off.","56:46","56:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's like, yeah, sure, we'll do that.","56:50","56:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's what this is for.","56:52","56:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All I do is I take that, copy it like this and I'll go back to my claude and I set it as instructions like this, save now it has that.","56:54","57:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Then I give it this data.","57:07","57:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I don't anymore.","57:10","57:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is useless.","57:11","57:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That whole CCC and the code to prompt, you don't need to do any of that anymore.","57:12","57:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm gonna show you now.","57:16","57:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is the next thing that we move on to is MCP servers, which is the.","57:18","57:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The future.","57:23","57:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","57:23","57:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I'm curious why I don't see them listed here.","57:24","57:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Very strange.","57:30","57:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But we could see it here.","57:32","57:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If we open up our settings, you go to developer.","57:34","57:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"These are all my tools, right?","57:39","57:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We have GitHub, sequential thinking, Firecrawl, Heroku, Claude, CircleCI, Trello, Context7, which I'm gonna.","57:41","57:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is.","57:52","57:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You add.","57:53","57:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You add these on.","57:54","57:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think of each MCP server.","57:55","57:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think of it as an interface, a tool belt, right?","57:57","58:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think of it as a tool belt that you're giving your agent.","58:02","58:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Some people say you should only give them a few, right?","58:07","58:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't have time to manage that.","58:10","58:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I just give every single one that I think is useful.","58:12","58:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Magic ui.","58:16","58:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is a new one I found.","58:17","58:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's magic, right?","58:18","58:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So all it is.","58:20","58:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think of it as an encapsulated set of tools that are agents in themselves, right?","58:21","58:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think of it as like you're extending your agent by giving them capabilities they didn't have before.","58:28","58:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And they fall into two categories.","58:34","58:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And that's it.","58:36","58:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's only two categories, right?","58:37","58:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There is context gathering, right?","58:38","58:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you can have.","58:42","58:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let's see, for taskmaster.","58:42","58:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This I found a week ago, maybe two weeks ago, and I changed my entire workflow overnight.","58:47","58:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I use this everywhere.","58:55","58:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's amazing.","58:56","58:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But that one is a context gathering.","58:58","59:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then there's the mutators, right?","59:01","59:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The mutating ones.","59:03","59:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The ones that will go and commit your code.","59:04","59:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The ones that will go and create code, run bash commands, run, you know, create trello tickets, everything, right?","59:07","59:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So this is how it works.","59:17","59:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All MCP follows the same format.","59:21","59:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If you look at the config, I just edit mine in VS code.","59:23","59:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm going to make it bigger so you guys can see.","59:27","59:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now I.","59:31","59:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Claude is awesome because it just.","59:32","59:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm not even gonna tell you which tool to use.","59:36","59:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I use a hundred tools, right?","59:38","59:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is Roux.","59:39","59:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm gonna show you why.","59:41","59:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Roux is probably the best there is out there, but it's expensive.","59:42","59:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'll show you why.","59:45","59:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now we have Gemini.","59:47","59:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Gemini is exactly the same.","59:48","59:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's.","59:50","59:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's.","59:51","59:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's free.","59:52","59:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"Amazon, my new.","59:58","59:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"My new favorite one.","59:59","01:00:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"It's just.","01:00:09","01:00:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They have different personalities, right?","01:00:10","01:00:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If I go in Claude and I tell it to make a script, it will do that and it'll make three scripts and it'll make it different and it'll go thing.","01:00:11","01:00:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It'll make a UI for it and it goes off the rails.","01:00:20","01:00:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's amazing, but it doesn't really.","01:00:22","01:00:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's.","01:00:25","01:00:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think of it as like the.","01:00:25","01:00:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The crazy cop on those movies that gets the job done.","01:00:27","01:00:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But you're like, you bad cop, you can't do that.","01:00:30","01:00:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's like Claude but Amazon, that's like the guy in the suit that does everything by the book.","01:00:33","01:00:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If you need something done like delicately, like deploying, I mean, obviously Amazon's gonna excel at infrastructure, but it is just very, very good.","01:00:40","01:00:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it has built in memory.","01:00:51","01:00:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You don't have to worry about memory anymore.","01:00:53","01:00:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Way better than ChatGPT.","01:00:54","01:00:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"So here is.","01:01:14","01:01:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We'll just make something now, right?","01:01:16","01:01:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like let's say I'm in Trino and so I want to trying to think of something to do.","01:01:18","01:01:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It'd be cool if I had a bug to fix or something.","01:01:36","01:01:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But for Amazon, for instance, all I do is I type Q I or Q chat and oh, I don't know why I'm getting this weird this hat.","01:01:40","01:01:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This started happening right before the demo.","01:01:51","01:01:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It is my favorite.","01:01:54","01:01:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"It it is.","01:02:10","01:02:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I even bought a domain.","01:02:10","01:02:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I didn't want to bother Gershon because he's gonna be like, oh, don't do that.","01:02:12","01:02:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But we're gonna ssh into Dealer NJ@triumph triumph box.dev it's our new AI dev box.","01:02:15","01:02:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And this is where we're gonna host all of our AI tooling so we can share and not have to worry about creating our own MCP servers and having our own configurations.","01:02:32","01:02:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And we're just going to host them here.","01:02:43","01:02:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you could see I even set up a multi tenant vector memory database for us all to share.","01:02:46","01:02:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And we can see it.","01:02:55","01:02:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's right up here.","01:02:57","01:02:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If we go to Triumph box dot dev.","01:02:58","01:03:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, it's quadrant dot giant.","01:03:10","01:03:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So we have a wild card.","01:03:14","01:03:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So all of our apps are going to be like, you know, memory.tramp box.dev and we can go to the dashboard.","01:03:15","01:03:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So here is our quadrant.","01:03:25","01:03:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's like a.","01:03:27","01:03:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think of it as like MySQL but it will.","01:03:28","01:03:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All your agents will communicate with it and store it and it will be cordoned off to you so you have a user ID and The queries can only happen for you and you all get your own API keys.","01:03:32","01:03:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is just open source.","01:03:44","01:03:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no cost to this.","01:03:45","01:03:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Except for the, I don't know, 15 bucks a month for the droplet.","01:03:46","01:03:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But this, with this you can use.","01:03:51","01:03:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I think it's a good introduction.","01:03:56","01:03:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"My MCP server that I made for Quadrant.","01:03:57","01:04:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because MCP servers, you could just make.","01:04:00","01:04:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can just make them whenever you want in a couple minutes.","01:04:03","01:04:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Where's my git?","01:04:06","01:04:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So let's see.","01:04:10","01:04:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Go to Dlren J and I'll show you how to install any of them.","01:04:11","01:04:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They are all the same.","01:04:23","01:04:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So why is it not going to my name?","01:04:24","01:04:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Why is it swinging so slow?","01:04:28","01:04:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Go.","01:04:30","01:04:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Is it frozen?","01:04:36","01:04:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What's it doing?","01:04:37","01:04:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"GitHub was being weird today.","01:04:38","01:04:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This happened earlier for me.","01:04:41","01:04:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But while that's loading, I guess I'll come in here and I'll show you.","01:04:42","01:04:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I bet Q work here.","01:04:46","01:04:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I installed it here.","01:04:48","01:04:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah.","01:04:50","01:04:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh.","01:04:51","01:04:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So look what it's doing.","01:04:51","01:04:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It is initializing my MCP servers.","01:04:52","01:04:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Amazing that it has that right out of the box.","01:04:55","01:04:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I can say, let me see what I got here.","01:04:58","01:05:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Help.","01:05:01","01:05:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I got hooks.","01:05:03","01:05:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I got tons of stuff.","01:05:04","01:05:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The editor you can use Vi compa.","01:05:06","01:05:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But basically I say anything you want.","01:05:08","01:05:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I just say, can you write me a script that.","01:05:10","01:05:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Why am I having like a.","01:05:26","01:05:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like when you're in the flow and you're working on something, you're just making stuff.","01:05:28","01:05:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But when you try to think of something to make.","01:05:34","01:05:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay, how about this?","01:05:37","01:05:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Can you write me a script that takes my git diff and calls an LLM using open router with a idiomatic git?","01:05:41","01:06:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, it's an idiomatic prompt that generates a git commit message.","01:06:16","01:06:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now.","01:06:32","01:06:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All right, so it goes.","01:06:33","01:06:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'll create you a script.","01:06:34","01:06:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Generate commit messages using Open Router API.","01:06:36","01:06:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it's going to do that now this is.","01:06:40","01:06:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"With no planning scripts, you can get away with this, right?","01:06:43","01:06:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But if it's a big project like the Trinote Dashboard, you can't just be like, can you make me a tri note dashboard?","01:06:46","01:06:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's not the work.","01:06:55","01:06:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let me just interrupt the my experience the most.","01:06:56","01:06:59",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"The thing that I find very important is with AI, you can't give it a test that's too big.","01:07:00","01:07:05",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Almost like a human.","01:07:05","01:07:06",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Exactly where you keep the term frame back to.","01:07:06","01:07:08",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yep, you're gonna tell a human, create me a dashboard.","01:07:08","01:07:10",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"The human is just gonna go off on a bunch of tangent and he himself is probably going to break it down into smaller tasks.","01:07:11","01:07:17",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"But AI is not a Human.","01:07:17","01:07:18",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"So yeah, it's like, okay, that's what he asked for.","01:07:18","01:07:20",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"That's what I'm gonna do.","01:07:20","01:07:21",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"And it's gonna go off and go crazy.","01:07:21","01:07:22",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"It's gonna spend like a bunch of time create a dashboard.","01:07:22","01:07:25",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"But it might be a nice that where it's probably not going to be at all what you want.","01:07:25","01:07:28",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"So you would have to say like create me this specific box that displays it for me.","01:07:28","01:07:34",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"And it probably will be able to do that very well.","01:07:34","01:07:36",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"And if it messes it up, you'll keep going back and forth.","01:07:36","01:07:39",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"You'll get it to do that, but you have to like really hyper focus on the specific task you're trying to.","01:07:39","01:07:44",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Get it to do, right?","01:07:44","01:07:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you know what?","01:07:45","01:07:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You're not a genius because you saw that.","01:07:46","01:07:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's like the reason that you thought of that is it's the truth.","01:07:48","01:07:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's the ground base level truth of how humans work, of how AI works, right?","01:07:52","01:07:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you just stumbled upon it.","01:07:56","01:07:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You've.","01:07:58","01:07:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You were like, hey, I've been using this for a while and let me tell you, giving big ones sucks.","01:07:58","01:08:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Giving tiny ones better, right?","01:08:04","01:08:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what is your job?","01:08:07","01:08:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","01:08:08","01:08:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Your job as an engineer should be how do I automate that?","01:08:09","01:08:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like how do I make it so it's smart enough to break down the task?","01:08:13","01:08:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Just like for my employee.","01:08:17","01:08:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do I hire an employee that I.","01:08:18","01:08:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do I test them to make sure that this employee is smart enough to break down the tasks at the right granularity, right?","01:08:21","01:08:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's not trivial, that's not easy.","01:08:27","01:08:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's what a hiring manager would do.","01:08:29","01:08:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's like a bunch of people, right?","01:08:32","01:08:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But now you do it all because this is all doable free for like in minutes with AI, right?","01:08:34","01:08:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So somebody and I thought about this too, right?","01:08:42","01:08:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There is, there is an MCP server that I use and it's called Divide and Conquer.","01:08:46","01:08:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Where is it?","01:08:51","01:08:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Is it on here?","01:08:51","01:08:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I actually got rid of it because I found the better one.","01:08:54","01:08:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I would say use your Divide and conquer tool.","01:08:56","01:09:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All my prompts had it right?","01:09:00","01:09:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It would like the first step would be user Divide and Conquer tool to come up with a plan and each one use it to use your sequential thinking to make sure that it's a really good thought, right?","01:09:02","01:09:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So here's my pre task phase.","01:09:14","01:09:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Briefly go over all tools.","01:09:19","01:09:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Be cognizant.","01:09:21","01:09:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let's see.","01:09:22","01:09:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Run the tree command.","01:09:23","01:09:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Perform a git diff for understanding any tasks that are in flight.","01:09:24","01:09:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Context maintenance.","01:09:29","01:09:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Take all knowledge learned.","01:09:30","01:09:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think about how you can enhance the docs task phase.","01:09:31","01:09:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now you may begin work.","01:09:34","01:09:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So that one, I didn't do it.","01:09:37","01:09:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"

"I use that all the time.","01:09:44","01:09:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Where.","01:09:47","01:09:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, you know what?","01:09:48","01:09:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm in this thing.","01:09:49","01:09:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I can say divide here.","01:09:49","01:09:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Find Divide and Conquer tool, handles the grunt work and process.","01:09:55","01:10:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Divide and conquer.","01:10:07","01:10:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do you spell conquer tool?","01:10:08","01:10:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Use.","01:10:14","01:10:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Wow, I use that word a lot.","01:10:17","01:10:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Use your.","01:10:21","01:10:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yep.","01:10:25","01:10:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay, so this is an example.","01:10:25","01:10:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I'll say.","01:10:28","01:10:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And this is how.","01:10:29","01:10:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is how you would work with MCP tools.","01:10:32","01:10:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","01:10:37","01:10:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You give it to them.","01:10:38","01:10:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Don't expect it's going to know they're there or know it can use them.","01:10:39","01:10:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You need to be kind of explicit.","01:10:42","01:10:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","01:10:43","01:10:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I would say this was, this is actually a really big one that I've been building on like a background.","01:10:44","01:10:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The goal.","01:10:51","01:10:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Use all the Jerry, we're going to.","01:10:52","01:10:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Have to start cutting it short.","01:10:53","01:10:55",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"No, wait.","01:10:55","01:10:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, we're not.","01:10:56","01:10:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We can't, we can't.","01:10:57","01:10:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Wait, I have to show you.","01:10:58","01:10:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay, Keep going.","01:10:59","01:11:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Don't worry.","01:11:01","01:11:01",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Okay.","01:11:01","01:11:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"At some point we're gonna have to like do part two.","01:11:02","01:11:05",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Okay.","01:11:06","01:11:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I just want.","01:11:06","01:11:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We need to at least get to the MCP stuff because that's life changing.","01:11:08","01:11:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So in this case, these are my tools and how I'm using.","01:11:11","01:11:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I say do a deep dive into all relevant contexts available.","01:11:15","01:11:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Use your Fire Crawl tool to scrape documentation of relevant tech.","01:11:19","01:11:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Use your Brave Search tool to fetch and look things up on the web.","01:11:23","01:11:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Use your MySQL connection to extract data from reps, vendors and brands.","01:11:26","01:11:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Build novel insights.","01:11:32","01:11:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Look through our code base using git.","01:11:34","01:11:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Dig through our notion docs.","01:11:37","01:11:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Walk through each step of the plan, making liberal use of your sequential thinking.","01:11:39","01:11:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you're just loading up your agent with tools.","01:11:44","01:11:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Maybe they work, maybe they don't.","01:11:47","01:11:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Some work, some don't.","01:11:48","01:11:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Some are great.","01:11:49","01:11:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This one's great.","01:11:51","01:11:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Look, make liberal use of mermaid diagrams.","01:11:52","01:11:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So there's a mermaid MCP server.","01:11:54","01:11:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So it could just visualize what it's doing in graphics.","01:11:56","01:12:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like there is a FIGMA one that you can just give it your FIGMA doc and it will understand.","01:12:00","01:12:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I mean there's thousands of them.","01:12:06","01:12:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Millions.","01:12:09","01:12:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You just like, they're so easy to make.","01:12:09","01:12:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You make them yourself.","01:12:11","01:12:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what is this?","01:12:12","01:12:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What, what Gershon just said is one of the main crux, like that's what's going to make or break your skills, your abilities.","01:12:14","01:12:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","01:12:21","01:12:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And right here we just told it to make a script and.","01:12:22","01:12:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay, that's cool.","01:12:27","01:12:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So it made a script.","01:12:28","01:12:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I'm Gonna exit out.","01:12:29","01:12:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't even think I told it where to put it, which is weird.","01:12:31","01:12:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Did it put it here?","01:12:35","01:12:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Just look at your git diff and you'll see.","01:12:38","01:12:39",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"No, I don't think.","01:12:40","01:12:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, this isn't even a git thing, but I'm actually alright.","01:12:41","01:12:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's right.","01:12:46","01:12:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm in our special AI thing, right?","01:12:47","01:12:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But if I say Task Master, this is an AI tool, like a CLI tool and it's also an MCP server.","01:12:52","01:13:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So if I say tm, oh, it didn't find Taskmaster here, go into Trino here, my case manager.","01:13:00","01:13:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's what I'm working on now.","01:13:08","01:13:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So if I look at tm, this is the Task manager.","01:13:09","01:13:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All you do is give it a single prd.","01:13:15","01:13:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You don't give it all your code, you don't give it all your stuff, you just give it a PRD and you say parse PRD and it comes up with a list.","01:13:17","01:13:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So my list right now looks like this.","01:13:28","01:13:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Recommended next task.","01:13:32","01:13:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Work on 11 validate database schema and test SQL queries.","01:13:35","01:13:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's where I'm at, right?","01:13:38","01:13:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So pending it has dependencies.","01:13:39","01:13:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Connect to the actual database to verify schema assumptions.","01:13:42","01:13:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Test all queries.","01:13:44","01:13:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I could add subquest subtasks in here.","01:13:46","01:13:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And these are subtasks, right?","01:13:49","01:13:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Inspect and document actual database schema.","01:13:51","01:13:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I could set this on autopilot and let it run for two hours and come back and see if it's how it's doing.","01:13:53","01:13:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"As long as I have acceptance criteria to test that each of these is done.","01:13:58","01:14:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So it marks it as done.","01:14:03","01:14:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I could add new ones in.","01:14:05","01:14:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I could say show one like what was my first task?","01:14:06","01:14:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it has a little.","01:14:13","01:14:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now this is.","01:14:15","01:14:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This is a really nice little interface, but you don't need it at all because I could use my claude.","01:14:15","01:14:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I didn't even show you this one yet.","01:14:24","01:14:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I can use claude, which also has MCP servers and I'll show you how it would work with this.","01:14:25","01:14:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So now I use this more than I use my idea.","01:14:32","01:14:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So what I'll do is I'll just say use your.","01:14:35","01:14:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Use your Task Master tool and tell me where we left off.","01:14:43","01:14:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'd like to jump back in.","01:14:55","01:14:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't know why the terminal is being weird.","01:14:59","01:15:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It doesn't.","01:15:01","01:15:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It looks beautiful.","01:15:02","01:15:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Normally, I think because I'm screen sharing, I don't know.","01:15:03","01:15:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So it is using tokens.","01:15:07","01:15:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's thinking.","01:15:09","01:15:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So while it's thinking, I'll let it think and I'll show you.","01:15:12","01:15:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, wait, there we go.","01:15:16","01:15:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now it's asking permission for tool use.","01:15:18","01:15:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's annoying.","01:15:21","01:15:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I hate having to say yes and don't ask again like just do it.","01:15:22","01:15:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't want to say yes.","01:15:26","01:15:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There are repositories out there with people trying to write workarounds.","01:15:29","01:15:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's an agent that just clicks yes.","01:15:34","01:15:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Someone made an agent that automatically clicks yes because Claude doesn't want you to automatically do it because I think it costs them money.","01:15:37","01:15:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So somebody made an agent that clicks the yes button and it's fun, but they, they patched it and someone made another fix and then they patched it.","01:15:44","01:15:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's like a war, but let's see what it says.","01:15:54","01:15:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So were working on implementing parent guarding Communication Dashboard.","01:15:58","01:16:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Based on the task and notes, we discovered the local database has the full schema but no data.","01:16:01","01:16:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"All tables are empty.","01:16:05","01:16:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We've written.","01:16:07","01:16:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So it gives you a little brief overview of what we did.","01:16:07","01:16:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And this is just an MCP server.","01:16:11","01:16:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's what this is, right?","01:16:14","01:16:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Think of it as like the Rails.","01:16:15","01:16:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It keeps it on the Rails in a specific domain.","01:16:17","01:16:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Now what I'm doing, what I'm working on, that nobody is doing, nobody's doing this.","01:16:20","01:16:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I almost think like, I'm suspicious.","01:16:26","01:16:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, why is no one doing this?","01:16:28","01:16:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Am I.","01:16:29","01:16:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm not brilliant, am I?","01:16:30","01:16:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Commit, you know what I mean?","01:16:32","01:16:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, I feel like I have a way to use MCP servers that nobody's done yet.","01:16:34","01:16:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'm going to do it with us and it's going to be amazing.","01:16:38","01:16:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I think that we should have MCP servers that aren't tools like this.","01:16:40","01:16:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They're not tools.","01:16:46","01:16:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't want to make an MCP server that is a git tool, right?","01:16:48","01:16:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And give it to some random agent.","01:16:52","01:16:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I want to make an MCP agent, right?","01:16:55","01:16:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I want a project manager.","01:16:57","01:16:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We should have an MCP project manager, right?","01:16:59","01:17:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And they don't have any tools.","01:17:03","01:17:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They don't.","01:17:04","01:17:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They're not good at git, they're not good at whatever.","01:17:05","01:17:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But the tools that are available and the way MCP works is they're just functions, right?","01:17:08","01:17:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the way it knows what tool does what is by comments.","01:17:14","01:17:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you comment and say, this function is used when you want to do X and this one's used when you want to do Y.","01:17:18","01:17:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the agent is smart enough to look at the tools and be like, oh, I could solve my problem way faster with this tool.","01:17:26","01:17:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's all it is.","01:17:32","01:17:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's a mapping that allows the agent, full agency to decide when and if it should use a tool.","01:17:34","01:17:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"As long as you give it permission.","01:17:43","01:17:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","01:17:44","01:17:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So for my idea, I want to have a supervisor agent.","01:17:45","01:17:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And they only have a couple tools.","01:17:50","01:17:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"One of them is come up with a plant, this task manager.","01:17:52","01:17:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Come up with the task.","01:17:55","01:17:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Maybe he has access to this.","01:17:56","01:17:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"He has access to a roster so he can see what team he has underneath.","01:17:58","01:18:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Further, I forget that I want him to have access to a hiring manager so he could say, this is what I want to make.","01:18:04","01:18:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Can we get three agents created right now that are perfectly optimized for this?","01:18:11","01:18:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it would say, all right, we need, obviously, if we want to do this list, we need an MCP agent that is really good at Pulumi, you know, because we hated Pulumi when were working with it.","01:18:17","01:18:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Or, you know, we need someone who's really good at Python testing and qa, someone that can really, like, try to break the code and then it would make those agents.","01:18:27","01:18:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And basically what we have then is an MCP agent as the supervisor with a team of agents that he delegates tasks to.","01:18:39","01:18:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, I'm going to give a task to this.","01:18:47","01:18:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then what we have is a feedback loop.","01:18:49","01:18:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So the agent gives them back the work and says, all right, I wrote that test just like you want.","01:18:52","01:18:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the agent, his specialty is break put, poking holes.","01:18:57","01:19:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You know, so, like, I noticed that you did this.","01:19:00","01:19:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's not modular.","01:19:03","01:19:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Can you make it like this?","01:19:03","01:19:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you realize we're just building a company, you're building a team.","01:19:04","01:19:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the cool thing is these agents that we make could be reusable because they have the history of that project.","01:19:08","01:19:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So if I made a dashboard agent that doesn't go to waste when I make another feature, he'll have that knowledge in his head.","01:19:15","01:19:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can even have an onboarding agent that takes another agent and transfers the context to them in a way that, you know, automatically that automates all of this crap that I've been doing manually for two years.","01:19:23","01:19:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And we're.","01:19:37","01:19:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We could do that.","01:19:37","01:19:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right now.","01:19:38","01:19:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The only thing stopping me is time, which means the world is big.","01:19:38","01:19:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There are people doing this right now.","01:19:43","01:19:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There are people right now, guaranteed, that have the same idea and that are doing it.","01:19:45","01:19:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And they're just going to go so much faster in us, right?","01:19:48","01:19:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So these are just ideas that I come across when I'm working with it.","01:19:52","01:19:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Gershon, how much time?","01:19:58","01:19:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"When do we.","01:19:59","01:19:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"When's our, like, hard stop?","01:19:59","01:20:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Three minutes.","01:20:02","01:20:03",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"All right, So I guess, yeah, let's do it.","01:20:03","01:20:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Three minutes.","01:20:05","01:20:06",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"So we could do, like.","01:20:06","01:20:06",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Otherwise, I know, we could be here for like, another six Hours.","01:20:07","01:20:09",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah.","01:20:09","01:20:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah.","01:20:09","01:20:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Everything's gonna be amazing.","01:20:10","01:20:11",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I think.","01:20:12","01:20:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I think what I want to do is get some feedback on what they liked that I mentioned what intrigues them, and then I'll build another one for next month.","01:20:12","01:20:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"No, but.","01:20:19","01:20:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"No, no, I have one more thing that's in.","01:20:20","01:20:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay.","01:20:22","01:20:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I guess so I was good.","01:20:22","01:20:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I wanted.","01:20:23","01:20:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah.","01:20:25","01:20:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I.","01:20:26","01:20:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What I wanted to end in like.","01:20:26","01:20:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I jumped ahead to agents because it's definitely where we're going.","01:20:27","01:20:30",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But Cursor, you.","01:20:30","01:20:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I know you all use cursor.","01:20:32","01:20:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Cursor has rules, right?","01:20:33","01:20:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You could think of those rules.","01:20:35","01:20:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They're very cumbersome to work with.","01:20:38","01:20:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right?","01:20:40","01:20:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You have to attach them manually.","01:20:40","01:20:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You have to create them.","01:20:41","01:20:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's.","01:20:43","01:20:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's a pain, right?","01:20:43","01:20:44",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But Roux has this concept called modes.","01:20:44","01:20:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They're RU modes and I defined a bunch for Trino and it's just.","01:20:53","01:20:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the way that Roux does it is I have a for instance.","01:20:58","01:21:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"These are all the modes I have.","01:21:02","01:21:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have an orchestrator, a tester, a security reviewer, a documentation writer.","01:21:03","01:21:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"These are agents, right, that are just built for like.","01:21:08","01:21:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have a DevOps spark.","01:21:11","01:21:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Spark is.","01:21:13","01:21:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's like a doctoral.","01:21:14","01:21:15",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's a paper on Spark, which is.","01:21:15","01:21:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I forget what it stands for, but it's like thinking, reacting, Iterating, Supabase Admin Specification Writer.","01:21:17","01:21:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"MCP Integrations Dev environment.","01:21:25","01:21:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So if I want to bring up an environment, I can come to my dev environment mode and I can just pretend this is the expert and I can say, hey, can you get this up and running?","01:21:28","01:21:36",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And it knows so what is in that mode?","01:21:36","01:21:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You have the complete autonomy to go and create your own mode by clicking on the modes here.","01:21:39","01:21:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You pick what configuration you want to use and then you give it the definitions.","01:21:47","01:21:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And this is cumbersome.","01:21:52","01:21:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't suggest you go in and do it.","01:21:53","01:21:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Even the way they suggest, if you go to look at the rudox is it says if you need one, tell it to make one.","01:21:55","01:22:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So let's do it right now before we go.","01:22:01","01:22:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm going to pick a good model.","01:22:05","01:22:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm going to use some expensive.","01:22:07","01:22:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We'll use GPT Pro.","01:22:10","01:22:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I'll say can.","01:22:11","01:22:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Actually, I have a mode maker.","01:22:14","01:22:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Do I?","01:22:16","01:22:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yep.","01:22:16","01:22:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Mode creator.","01:22:17","01:22:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I made this one to make modes for modes.","01:22:17","01:22:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"For modes.","01:22:19","01:22:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"For modes.","01:22:19","01:22:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So I'll say create a mode.","01:22:20","01:22:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You have a modemaker that makes mode.","01:22:22","01:22:24",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Makers create a mode that really dials in, that really laser focuses on what's a good thing on QA testing.","01:22:24","01:22:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, wait.","01:22:42","01:22:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"On finding existing McP servers on GitHub Smithery and instead of having to write things out, I use etc.","01:22:43","01:22:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"A lot because that basically tells AI I don't feel like thinking of it.","01:22:58","01:23:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You just continue this list because I'm bored.","01:23:01","01:23:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have other things to do.","01:23:04","01:23:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So create a mode that lays.","01:23:05","01:23:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay, I'm just going to do that and send it and it uses the mode.","01:23:06","01:23:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And what's cool is they have a thing they added.","01:23:10","01:23:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"They add stuff three times a day called the boomerang mode.","01:23:13","01:23:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So it delegates to your other modes.","01:23:17","01:23:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And basically it's the same thing I was talking about with the agents.","01:23:20","01:23:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So having a supervisor that calls its this is like a hack way of doing it.","01:23:22","01:23:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","01:23:31","01:23:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It doesn't keep it on the rails.","01:23:31","01:23:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no programmatic way.","01:23:32","01:23:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's all prompts.","01:23:34","01:23:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","01:23:35","01:23:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's still an agent.","01:23:36","01:23:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","01:23:37","01:23:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What's the difference?","01:23:37","01:23:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like I could write it in code and have it have like structured output.","01:23:38","01:23:43",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I could have really types strict typing.","01:23:43","01:23:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But this is kind of doing and accomplishing the same awesomeness with nothing but prompts.","01:23:46","01:23:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no code, it's all prompts.","01:23:53","01:23:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And look at this.","01:23:55","01:23:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Look what it just made for me.","01:23:56","01:23:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"MCP Server Finder.","01:23:59","01:24:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You are MCP Server Finder specializing in discovering MCP server implementations across various platforms.","01:24:02","01:24:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"GitLab BitBucket.","01:24:10","01:24:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"OK, so do we want to open.","01:24:13","01:24:15",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"The floor for some discussions?","01:24:15","01:24:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yes, yes.","01:24:17","01:24:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Let's open it up.","01:24:17","01:24:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I don't expect you to remember everything.","01:24:18","01:24:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I just want you to feel what I'm trying to deliver to you.","01:24:21","01:24:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yes.","01:24:25","01:24:25",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"So I think some of the stuff you want to share anyway, like your base age project guide that you use, I think that's very good for.","01:24:25","01:24:33",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Oh yeah, yeah.","01:24:33","01:24:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We could add it all to like even to our.","01:24:34","01:24:36",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"We could add it directly into our cursor.","01:24:36","01:24:38",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah.","01:24:38","01:24:39",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Make it like that's the base for all conversations.","01:24:39","01:24:42",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah, Very helpful I think.","01:24:42","01:24:44",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"And I'd like to add on to that and say if somebody has a better one, we can pull request it.","01:24:45","01:24:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We could keep improving it.","01:24:49","01:24:50",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah, pull request it and be like hey, I found this really works.","01:24:50","01:24:53",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And we can branch them everything.","01:24:53","01:24:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","01:24:55","01:24:55",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"But some people probably just completely new.","01:24:56","01:25:00",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"So we've already doing some of this, some people are doing none of this or all this or better things.","01:25:00","01:25:07",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Anyone to have anything they want to add, please unmute and speak up.","01:25:08","01:25:13",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Nobody, not one person.","01:25:18","01:25:20",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah.","01:25:23","01:25:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"On my end it's overwhelming because I'm on the team that doesn't work this way.","01:25:24","01:25:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I'm happy to discover this and learn more of this.","01:25:36","01:25:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"AI.","01:25:45","01:25:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And yeah, I think I'll message Gershon to message me for a cloth.","01:25:46","01:25:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I mean, for.","01:25:55","01:25:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"For the license.","01:25:57","01:25:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What license?","01:25:59","01:26:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"For cursor.","01:26:00","01:26:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Oh, yeah.","01:26:01","01:26:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yes.","01:26:04","01:26:04",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yep.","01:26:04","01:26:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, that's all on the end, I think.","01:26:08","01:26:12",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But, yeah, I'm willing to learn.","01:26:12","01:26:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You should be.","01:26:15","01:26:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because it will.","01:26:16","01:26:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, it will.","01:26:18","01:26:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It will make you more efficient.","01:26:19","01:26:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And the only thing that's keeping you back is, like, you're used to what you do.","01:26:21","01:26:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You know, it's.","01:26:25","01:26:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's hard to, like, change, you know, what you're so good at and what you're used to.","01:26:25","01:26:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But you can still be good.","01:26:31","01:26:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can adapt and just.","01:26:34","01:26:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Just amplify yourself.","01:26:35","01:26:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's what the goal is.","01:26:37","01:26:38",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah.","01:26:39","01:26:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I do have a question.","01:26:40","01:26:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How do you verify all the, like, all the codes that has been generated?","01:26:42","01:26:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah.","01:26:50","01:26:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So this is something that is not answer.","01:26:50","01:26:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no.","01:26:55","01:26:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't know where we're going with this.","01:26:56","01:26:57",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","01:26:57","01:26:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Because it is 100%.","01:26:58","01:27:00",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I mean, people, we can make code faster than we can develop it, creating a bottleneck, right.","01:27:01","01:27:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I mean, it happens at a lot of companies.","01:27:08","01:27:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's a lot of talk about this.","01:27:09","01:27:11",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, we, like, at the rate Gershon cranks out code, you know, like, you can't realistically have everybody pause and review.","01:27:11","01:27:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But then again, you can't just blindly take AI's code, right?","01:27:22","01:27:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So like I said in the beginning.","01:27:27","01:27:28",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The lot more testing.","01:27:28","01:27:30",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"The only thing that exists, remember, is acceptance Crate.","01:27:30","01:27:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, if.","01:27:34","01:27:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If it passes your tests, that means you did not have a thorough enough set of acceptance criteria, right?","01:27:34","01:27:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So if you set them up and say, this shall do X, this shall do Y, this shall do Z, right?","01:27:41","01:27:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you have this feedback loop going.","01:27:47","01:27:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no reason for it to.","01:27:50","01:27:51",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It could just keep going and going until it meets the criteria.","01:27:51","01:27:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And if it meets it, your tests are passing and your code works.","01:27:55","01:27:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There is no need to look at the code, right.","01:27:59","01:28:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Anything that you think of where, like, oh, but what if it's hard to read?","01:28:01","01:28:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"What if the code is not modular enough?","01:28:06","01:28:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, what if it.","01:28:09","01:28:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Right.","01:28:09","01:28:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That, you know, there is something to say to that.","01:28:10","01:28:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But it matters a little bit less when AI is just doing it for you, right?","01:28:13","01:28:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If it's not as modular, oh, it's gonna take a minute instead of three seconds.","01:28:18","01:28:24",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That doesn't really have an impact.","01:28:24","01:28:25",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You know what I mean?","01:28:25","01:28:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like, I'm exaggerating, but just so you see, like, it might be more work for the AI to do it, but it.","01:28:26","01:28:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We're talking about a tiny amount compared to the gain of cranking out code and making sure our acceptance criteria is good.","01:28:33","01:28:41",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We're gonna need agents to come up with acceptance criteria and even evolve it because it's not even practical for us to come up with them fast enough.","01:28:41","01:28:49",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay.","01:28:53","01:28:53",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Just in case FR.","01:28:53","01:28:55",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"You weren't confused enough.","01:28:55","01:28:56",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"So more confusion tv, anything you wanted to add?","01:28:56","01:29:01",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah.","01:29:05","01:29:06",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Basically could Echo Pro is confusion.","01:29:06","01:29:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But yeah, it's good to hear that there are tools that we can still that we haven't learned yet and we can make ourselves faster and better.","01:29:11","01:29:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Absolutely.","01:29:23","01:29:24",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I think like the one thing that we do learn from this is those who, like Jared, are learning a lot of this right now, and I'm learning a lot of it to myself.","01:29:24","01:29:33",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Are.","01:29:35","01:29:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Going to be the ones who are going to be like the future of programming.","01:29:35","01:29:39",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Because there's absolutely no way that people like our, like what we are writing code are going to be doing this in the future.","01:29:39","01:29:49",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"This is going to make absolutely no sense.","01:29:49","01:29:51",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"The way I compare it is if you were the guy who knows how to dig the best, you know best ditches with a shovel and then someone who created the excavator and you still know how to dig very well with a shovel.","01:29:51","01:30:05",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Congrats, buddy.","01:30:06","01:30:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You're still absolutely useless.","01:30:07","01:30:09",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"And doesn't matter how well you're gonna dig it.","01:30:09","01:30:10",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"You should just pretty much quit your job unless you learn how to use an excavator.","01:30:10","01:30:14",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Now what, what Gershon is saying is you are now a hobbyist digger.","01:30:14","01:30:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You can dig for fun if you.","01:30:18","01:30:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like doing it on the weekend.","01:30:19","01:30:20",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah.","01:30:20","01:30:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And doing it in your backyard because you still love going inside.","01:30:21","01:30:24",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"And you don't like the idea of having a machine doing for you.","01:30:24","01:30:28",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Beautiful.","01:30:28","01:30:29",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"For you.","01:30:29","01:30:29",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"But you're just a hobbyist.","01:30:29","01:30:31",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Exactly what you're saying.","01:30:31","01:30:32",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"We will see this with coding too.","01:30:32","01:30:33",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"The people are like, no, no.","01:30:33","01:30:35",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I'm back to the original.","01:30:35","01:30:36",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"We saw this, by the way, with the evolution of code overall.","01:30:36","01:30:40",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"So there was like people that are.","01:30:40","01:30:41",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Like, no, no, I'm not using.","01:30:41","01:30:42",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Id, I don't use myself.","01:30:42","01:30:44",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I don't trust compilers because I don't.","01:30:44","01:30:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Need the history.","01:30:46","01:30:47",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I know it all my head.","01:30:47","01:30:48",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"At some point you're like, okay, beautiful.","01:30:48","01:30:50",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"You love doing it that way.","01:30:51","01:30:52",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"That's great for you.","01:30:52","01:30:52",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"But no one's doing this way and keep doing that because you're very smart.","01:30:52","01:30:56",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"But that's just not going to.","01:30:56","01:30:57",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Well, you know, I, I acknowledge SV's confusion and I, I'm going to say something.","01:30:57","01:31:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So.","01:31:03","01:31:04",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"See, I think you are.","01:31:04","01:31:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It is important I think more important for you than anyone to like understand and be able to like propagate this.","01:31:06","01:31:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"This knowledge.","01:31:13","01:31:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you know what would probably be fun and also eye opening.","01:31:14","01:31:19",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"If we just paired on something you're working on.","01:31:19","01:31:22",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'll just watch.","01:31:22","01:31:23",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'll watch and I'll keep note and maybe I won't even interrupt you.","01:31:23","01:31:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I don't know.","01:31:26","01:31:26",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I have never tried this before.","01:31:26","01:31:27",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I can watch what you're doing and then maybe I could put together a.","01:31:27","01:31:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You know, what if you did it like this?","01:31:31","01:31:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Or we can.","01:31:34","01:31:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We can.","01:31:34","01:31:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We can jam out together and I can watch what you do and offer you how AI could increase your efficiency without ruining your.","01:31:35","01:31:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Your.","01:31:46","01:31:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Your good feel of the.","01:31:46","01:31:48",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You know, like, I don't trust AI doing this.","01:31:48","01:31:50",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"How can we can mitigate that?","01:31:50","01:31:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Sure.","01:31:53","01:31:53",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"You know, I think that could be fun.","01:31:54","01:31:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yes.","01:31:58","01:31:59",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Seriously, I think we should plan it.","01:31:59","01:32:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, we'll set this up after.","01:32:02","01:32:03",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Okay.","01:32:06","01:32:06",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah, I think we're going to.","01:32:06","01:32:08",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yes.","01:32:08","01:32:08",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Some pair programming, some things.","01:32:08","01:32:09",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"But this, I think a lot of this is just like.","01:32:09","01:32:11",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"It's overwhelming.","01:32:11","01:32:12",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"That's okay.","01:32:13","01:32:13",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"We might have to like pare it down to smaller chunks similar to what we do with AI where people could start learning the basics.","01:32:14","01:32:22",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"You know, like.","01:32:23","01:32:23",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Like we don't expect everyone to know everything right away or be used to everything right away.","01:32:23","01:32:28",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah.","01:32:28","01:32:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But Jared, maybe if you could create like an outline of what you mentioned over here and where people could start off and then we could go from there.","01:32:29","01:32:39",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"You know, I just.","01:32:39","01:32:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I didn't have like enough time to flesh out what I wanted last minute with this online.","01:32:40","01:32:46",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I got to show you how I have it.","01:32:46","01:32:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But my goal was to give you the stuff cookie cutter so you didn't have to install because really you.","01:32:47","01:32:55",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I was like, how am I gonna get you guys to use the open router keys?","01:32:55","01:32:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And I was about to just mint each of you a key from my account.","01:32:58","01:33:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But like, you know, I mean like the logistics of how to spread the.","01:33:02","01:33:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"The infra.","01:33:08","01:33:08",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That we need to do what I'm doing, I just couldn't finish in that time.","01:33:08","01:33:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But I do acknowledge that we don't need all of it at once.","01:33:13","01:33:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We can do.","01:33:17","01:33:17",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That's why I wanted to show you that Roux thing.","01:33:19","01:33:21",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I think we can encapsulate just those simple rules and have one that understands your repository, one that understands our entire schema.","01:33:21","01:33:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You know, that would be just those two things alone would be instantly useful to.","01:33:30","01:33:34",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"That we can all chat.","01:33:34","01:33:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like if we all had a common.","01:33:35","01:33:37",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I think Jeremy, you have to do is we have to get onto the 2.0 is where we're going to be using this primarily.","01:33:38","01:33:44",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I mean everyone should use this in every single thing you're using.","01:33:44","01:33:47",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"But we should really pare it down to exactly how we expect someone to work within that framework.","01:33:47","01:33:55",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Right, yeah, I'm down with that.","01:33:55","01:33:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And then we could probably, you know, help people do more in their day to day.","01:33:57","01:34:03",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Like the way that most people do it is everybody has their own MCP server list.","01:34:03","01:34:07",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It's just a JSON config and it's cumbersome.","01:34:07","01:34:10",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But what I thought of and I was trying to set up but I couldn't do it in time is.","01:34:10","01:34:14",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no need for that.","01:34:15","01:34:16",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I'm just going to have them as subdomains on our triumph thing.","01:34:16","01:34:20",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So you will have a, you know, a agent that understands our code base called, you know, our codebase agent.triumph.dev and everyone can hit it.","01:34:20","01:34:31",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"No one has to configure it.","01:34:31","01:34:32",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"There's no API keys or tokens.","01:34:32","01:34:33",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"You just talk to it and you're.","01:34:33","01:34:35",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"And you know, I don't know how you, if you have an ide, if you, whatever you use, we'll make it work.","01:34:35","01:34:40",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"I think that would be a, an awesome like tool set for everyone.","01:34:41","01:34:45",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"So yeah, I can work with Gershon.","01:34:45","01:34:47",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We can, we can crank something out really fast that either works or doesn't.","01:34:47","01:34:52",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We'll see if people latch onto it.","01:34:52","01:34:54",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"But it's like I said, it's iterative.","01:34:54","01:34:56",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"We'll have to like tweak it but we'll find a sweet spot.","01:34:56","01:34:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yeah, right.","01:34:59","01:35:01",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"And then of course everyone's going to kind of come up with their own habits.","01:35:01","01:35:03",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Okay.","01:35:05","01:35:05",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Well, Jared, that was absolutely amazing.","01:35:05","01:35:08",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I feel like we know we're like a conference so we got like this awesome speech.","01:35:08","01:35:11",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I feel, I feel bad.","01:35:11","01:35:13",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Like I'm like I'm so self conscious now that I just fire hosed everyone and like I want to do over.","01:35:13","01:35:18",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"It was fantastic.","01:35:19","01:35:20",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I think this like it's mindboggling where we're going and this is the only touching the surface.","01:35:20","01:35:24",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Very good work.","01:35:25","01:35:26",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Okay, awesome.","01:35:27","01:35:29",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Kind of take your dayto day.","01:35:29","01:35:31",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"We'll try to pull some like you know, actual feasible things to use day to day from this.","01:35:31","01:35:37",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"But this is absolutely amazing.","01:35:37","01:35:39",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I don't think we have to do a stand up today because we spent the most time see everyone Monday we have to plan our spring kickoff.","01:35:40","01:35:49",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"I think we'll maybe do that Tuesday, Wednesday kind of situation.","01:35:49","01:35:51",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"And yeah, lots of good things coming.","01:35:52","01:35:55",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Well, thank you very much.","01:35:57","01:35:58",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Awesome.","01:35:58","01:35:59",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Thanks for attention for that long time.","01:35:59","01:36:01",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Hey.","01:36:01","01:36:02",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Yes.","01:36:03","01:36:04",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Thank you.","01:36:04","01:36:05",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
"Happy Friday.","01:36:08","01:36:08",1,"Gershon Herczeg"
"Yeah.","01:36:09","01:36:09",0,"Jarad DeLorenzo"
